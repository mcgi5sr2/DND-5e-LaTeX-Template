\section{Background}

\subsection*{Details} 

Welcome to the world of Velterra, domain of the Seven, who rule over all from afar through the constant vigilance of the Church.

“In Hope’s Rest, the largest city of the Empire of the Seven, a cloaked man dashes over rooftops, a half-burnt tome tucked under one arm as a group of mercenaries chase him. Abruptly he comes to a dead end, a roof with nowhere to leap to and nowhere to hide. He turns to face his attackers and reaches for his weapons, the book slipping from his grasp as he does so. In a moment of panic he spins to grab for the book, losing his balance and toppling from the roof as the mercenaries swing their blades at his back.”

“In the north, a pair of goblin twins flee the perils of Valkar Varg’s reign, seeking the freedom and new life the south can bring. They are surrounded by brutal tribesmen and vicious axes on all sides, angered by their desertion. As the two goblins look at each other in desperation and anger they nod, the girl raising a long rifle that quivers with electricity, the boy raising a small hunting bow and quickly loosing several arrows. As their enemies close in the bow-user pulls a vial of some mysterious viscous liquid as his twin sister unclips a thrumming round device from her belt. In moments, a huge explosion rips through the area.”

“To the south, a dwarf pastor sits hunched over a tome, scribbling notes. He raises his head as he hears the slow creak of his door, aware that he is expecting no visitors. He stands and turns to see a hulking figure behind him, armoured with a long-barelled gun at his side. The dwarf rests a trembling hand on his holster as a man who should not exist stands before him. Terse words are exchanged, accusations and threats. The dwarf grits his teeth and sets his feet, drawing the pistol at his side as his opponent does the same. From outside, the sound of a single shot being fired can be heard.”

“To the East, a figure wrapped in cloth and strange garments sits quietly in a harbour tavern in Port Averdale, recently arrived on the continent from a long voyage. She sits with an untouched mug of unappealing ale in front of her as three thugs approach the table. They slam down a parchment on the table with a picture and a hefty figure. In a flash she is to her feet, blade drawn and two of the men sliced apart on the ground. She faces the remaining thug who whistles and a stream of men pour into the building from all around. Outnumbered by scores and with a demand the surrender, she chooses the only option she knows. Honour.”
