\subsection{Episode 30: Lessons in Colour Theory. and Dem BONES!}
\DndDropCapLine{A}n empty room. Bzzzzzt….. Bzzzzzt....\medskip
Pale blue lights flick on and off.\medskip
Zoink.\medskip
A load of fuckheads suddenly appear. They argue for a bit, then go and look at the metal door that leads out of the room. It scrapes open slightly, jarring about 2 feet up.\medskip
All the fuckheads are short fuckheads, apart from the monkey one, so they barely even have to duck.\medskip
Some of them file through the doorway, and some of them stay in the room to try and steal the light fittings. They succeed, and then get upset that it gets dark. Fuckheads, see.\medskip
The ones that have gone under the door find a load of rocks on the ground. The grumpy one in the hat pokes it with the end of his gun sword thing. It only goes and builds itself into a guy. He’s a fancy marble butler guy.\medskip
The grumpy hat one tells him to go and put some clothes on for a reason probably. He opens a secret cupboard and gets dressed. The monkey one offers the posh rock a big bag of mixed offal. Again, probably a reason.\medskip
The little green boy goes and watches him get dressed.\medskip
I say “dressed”, but he’s just pinning bits of fabric onto himself.\medskip
He comes back out, and the grumpy hat one gives him more shit. What a bellend.\medskip
The little green boy has accidentally put a bag on his head, and explores it until further notice.\medskip
The posh rock becomes called Oovwaw, he wasn’t before. Everyone realises he doesn’t have hands, and everyone has a whole bunch of questions.\medskip
The grumpy hat one abbreviates “probably” to “probs”. It’s totes in character.\medskip
Oovwaw finally gets round to telling everyone where they are. This is the Tower of Rubrix. This is the last remaining area of the Tower of Rubrix that isn’t full of bad shit. The posh rock has kept this area safe for many centuries, as the results of Rubrix’s experiments have taken over the rest of it.\medskip
Somewhere in the tower, is the puzzle die, which these fuckheads apparently want.\medskip
Apparently, the tower has been teleported deep underground.\medskip
The posh rock has some pretty mixed feelings about his creator, which apparently means he’s happy to help people steal all his shit. The fuckheads and the posh rock just do a lot of hangin’ talking about shit.\medskip
The grumpy beardy metal one and the little green girl go and help the green boy get the bag off his head.\medskip
The rest of them fill him in, but realise it doesn’t take long, due to the pre-mentioned hangin’ about.\medskip
Poshrock says that this is the 5th floor and that the puzzle die is downstairs on the first floor.\medskip
When asked what’s inbetween here and there, Poshrock gives a nice summary:\medskip
Lvl 4: Snake People Lvl 3: The Zoo Lvl 2: [data incomplete] Lvl 1: The place where the thing is\medskip
Myron has never seen a snake, and doesn’t know why everyone else has. Everyone tries to describe one. Apparently it’s basically a long crocodile.\medskip
The fuckheads all go into the next area, and there’s a pointy stone thing with a big red ball on top. Everyone tries to tell the monkey to punch the orb, but he only pokes it with a stick, because he’s a bad, cowardly pet.\medskip
The green boy touches it with his hand and it turns lots of colours. Nothing happens for a bit, and then everyone starts floating. Obvs.\medskip
Eventually they’re walking on the ceiling like it’s the floor, but it seems like everyone fails to really grasp the central concept.\medskip
There’s some general Fizzy Lifting Drinks Hijinx, and then everyone notices a door in the ceiling.\medskip
The green children scoot off to go and have a look in it. They find lots of bottles of shit. Grumpyhat scoots up and gets given an orange one.\medskip
They have fun morally ambiguous times.\medskip
He looks down towards the rest of the group, and see the monkey failing to use a water bottle.\medskip
Being helpful, he teaches the monkey one to drink, using the helpful teaching aid he just acquired.\medskip
Drinking the orange potion turns the monkey orange. Bonkers.\medskip
The green children put the orb back in the thing and the gravity goes back.\medskip
Once back on the ground, they go and go through the door that’s on the floor.\medskip
In that room, there’s a user manual for a security system based on a colour assignment. Each category of apprentice was assigned a colour and would only be allowed in areas corresponding to that colour.\medskip
They go to the door that leads out of the gravity room and it’s orange.\medskip
The monkey one touches the door and it hurts him real bad. The green boy thinks he did it wrong, so he touches it too. He hurts real bad too. Lessons are not learnt. They likely never will be.\medskip
Eventually they work out that purple is the answer.\medskip
The green boy tries to explain to everyone why purple’s the answer. No one understands, and resents him for trying to teach them. He writes it down for them, using pictograms where appropriate.\medskip
They be purple, and get through the door.\medskip
They’re in a room with two orange doors leading off it and a big purple wall splitting it in half. There’s a bowl just by the edge of it. Grumpyhat goes into one of the orange side-rooms and finds neat piles of bones.\medskip
Them bones are dry.\medskip
Them bones.\medskip
Poshrock has been tidying up all the bones that he finds around this tower, and is unhappy that Grumphat would mess them up. They wonder why no one likes them.\medskip
The green girl finds a bedroom, with impeccably made beds.\medskip
Grumpyhat messes the beds up. What is with that guy?\medskip
The little green girl acts strangely.\medskip
There’s some attempts at puzzle solving, as it looks like there’s a forcefield over all but the very top of this purple wall. The monkey one jumps over. This doesn’t help anyone. Any people, anyway.\medskip
Eventually, people think about doing the whole, you know, reversing gravity thing to get over the bit at the top. They do it. Blah, blah, blah. They go the fuck downstairs.\medskip
TO THE SNAKES\medskip
The film awkwardly just cuts to black as someone's halfway through a sentence. After a minute of silence, you can hear distant music, as if playing from a different rooms.\medskip
