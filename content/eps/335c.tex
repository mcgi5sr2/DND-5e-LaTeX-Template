\subsection{Episode 33.5c: Two days from retirement}\medskip
\DndDropCapLine{I}t was a dark and stormy night, and trevor was hard at work in the kitchen. He looks across the kitchen to see the arcanist still sat in his salty brine filled barrel.\medskip
Perhaps one day he too will be a book burner like the others, and get to hunt Goliaths of ill repute, and arcanists that need to be dee-salted in brine. Why the kitchen is in the stables though, that is something that he wishes he had asked before everyone left. Martha had cooked a massive meal, but that was all ancient history now.\medskip
Now he looked more closely the arcanists wa smore of a bloody mess than a person now, Sandis cross examination technique had been very effective. The arcanist kept banging on about the Cult of Annihilators but the book burners were a fan of that kind of behaviour. He would have been better company if he still had his skin, or even if he was still there and hadn’t disappeared entirely.\medskip
His new job is to carry out an investigation on Bernie himself! Martha let him know before “she” left that he might be a traitor to the cause, what with all the not burning that arcanist and all.\medskip
Martha arrives at the Assassins guild with a burning desire to get this bernie issue resolved asap. The fact that one of the oldest and highest ranking members of the book burners has turned arcanist on us all, would be a betrayal of epic levels. Would the church shut us down? Or worse? Would we lose our license.\medskip
The masked speaker is thrilled to see Bones again, they must have been good friends at some point.\medskip
“Hello Stacey”\medskip
Professor of Anatomy not Horatio, but Mary has disappeared internally, along with a load of students.\medskip
The tunnel is underneath the Assassins guild, and has funny creatures eating people. As its an occult matter then the book burners have to check it out, Sadly the price of the contract isn’t high enough to cover the required solution to the bernie problem. We will have to go outside the the assassins guild.\medskip
The tunnels are dark and spoopy, so much so that Martha vomits a lot. We arrive at a large metal door, who would not mention that they had a metal door on their tunnel? This must mean its man made rather than animal. Geeze its hard door, even the combined efforts of Motivator and Martha cant shift it. Bones knives it good and proper, and still no result.\medskip
Luckily someone notices us and opens the door from the other side. Let the freeform conversations begin. Bodies of crab, head of person. Sandi introduces the lady crab to her boot of destiny, her destiny is unclear. Treyvon loses his shit and rushed into man-crab, luckily he isn’t asking Martha where the children are because she doesn’t know either. Motivator punches the crab man, losing his stick in the process. Bones stabs the shit out of lady, crab, then back hand scalpels man-crab.\medskip
Crab man escapes by burrowing his way out, Treyvon makes haste in the pursuit and apologises to his spirit animal papa cub for having feathers, being a bird, and not digging very well. Next step he dodges a spinning blade, and avoids an inspectors nightmare.\medskip
Marhta knocks on the door, while Motivator motivates the self confident door. It then melts much to her surprise exposing a “sphere of annihilation” she pushes Sandi out the way, taking the brunt of the sphere herself. We then get smashed by the dangerous blades trap we wanted to inspect for safety reasons.\medskip
Treyvon lets us know that putting a virgin into the sphere of annihilation would close it.\medskip
Motivator runs into the spheres room and punches the bejebus out of the emo goth in a big dark cloak. Treyvon runs, spreads his wings, then glide shoves the guy backwards into the sphere of annihilation. The cultists come back with a vengeance and pathetic slap Treyvon and Motivator.Bones sticks a finger up one of the cultists noses, its very confusing. Sandi gets it right and throws one down the well the other right next to it, killing most of them! Sphere of annihilation retaliates, its bad news for Sandy, but every sweet westling move has its cost. Martha starts the greasing process for the hole. Treyvon tickles them, to humurous effect. Bones jumps into the well, and in so doing avoids the massive energy wave from the sphere of annihilation. “ Well Well Well” says Sandy, which is perfect because the guy isnt in the well anymore. It terrifies the dude, and Sandy tries to push the guy in the well, but he is levitating. Treyvon loses some feather to the sphere of annihilation. Motivator sticks it to the man!\medskip
Treyvon makes pulsar eyes and tries to take control of the sphere, its not super effective.\medskip
Sandi puts on the coat of the boss, and runs over to punch the remaining cultist, its the punch of death.\medskip
With everyone dead, bones works out how to leave the well. The Sphere moves back to its default position, and everyone tries to take control of the sphere, while bones wears the bosses skin as a suit.\medskip
Bones makes a new friend in the well, who then borrows him a ladder! Its crab-man, he is literally a wet dream for Bones! He was made by the mistress, crabman will now take us to her.\medskip
Letter says to keep people away from her research FF. Gary is perhaps from the theives guild.\medskip
“Gary, I don't care about your cult. I'm just working with you because the eye demands it. That idiot Paul lost his operation earlier. Keep them away from my research. FF” Trevon offers sugar to the nice crab lady, and Martha spangs her with a frying pan.\medskip
Sandy pulls the door partly open, as Bones jnr slips under the door. With our powers combined we open a door.\medskip
Some investigation later and a few rats by the side, Sandi lights up her zippo and gets ready to rumble!\medskip
Sandi trips and pins the Mistress (frankenfur!!, allowing Martha to come in and grase them both up.\medskip
Treyvon hocks up a lovely lovely egg. Before going to shank the mistress, Motivator then comes in with the beating stick.\medskip
Bones knows the mistress, she has been reading….\medskip
Teryvon Jnr gets eaten by Bones Jnr. It is awful, awful, awful. Tears of pain stream down his cheeks, as he carries the carcass to bones. Bones goes super doctor, even cleaning his scalpel.\medskip
Bones switches arms with a tentacle beast, it gets very japan anime style. Its not right. At all.\medskip
Bones betrays us all, and decides to stay with Frankenfur.\medskip
MiCrowCephaly, is a great name for Treyvorns son.\medskip
Its agreed the case is now Bones’ to sort out with the assassins.\medskip
Pilch has been asleep down here all the time. Turns out he was captured and forced to stay in here.\medskip
Turns out there is an exit to the Cathedral. Looks like another bang up job done by the book burners.\medskip
We get back to the book burners HQ and it turns out the Pilch has fucked us, and been trying to sell book she was meant to burn/hand over to the church. So its a purge, everyone agrees to help, pretty much, even if some people have better things to be doing.\medskip
Bones take to the roof tops, and Martha and Bernie are on distraction duty. Treyvorn re-inserts the child into himself. This is the fucking worst! What is wrong with you all!\medskip
Treyvorn goes all out, and swings into action. Lilltih pops out of a barrel and shoots someone. Bones runs across a washing line., slipping and becoming a piece of washing on the line.Motivator engages the run and superman punch, killing the guy outright. So far so good, fuck the gunned mercenaries. Martha tries to get into some back door action, but its a no show so frying pan time. Sandi ducks and doesn’t cover, running in for the fast pace punch time. She hits, she kills!\medskip
Treyvorn gets his rage on, and gets some bad doge roll going on on him. Despite landing on some guttering he gets railed by the arbiters repeater rifle.\medskip
Bones is off and about on the roof, getting ready to stabby stabby. Motivator goes all out on the arbiter.\medskip
Treyvon puts his child into a basket on the roof then dives into combat - eventually he is murdered by the Arbiter and he falls, squaking with his last breath "Damn, I was only two days from retirement".\medskip
Martha goes fire crazy trying to save Burnie and burns half the bookburners before dying to the remaining mercenaries, not realising that Burnie is still outside and perfectly fine.\medskip
Bones leaves with the mutant crow baby to raise it and continue his work with Frankenfurter.\medskip
Motivator and Sandi survive as just as they are getting overwhelmed Pilch arrives, the arbiter shoots pilch but his gun explodes. Pilch flees and the mercenaries chase him, leading to the intro in the prologue where Pilch meets his maker at the hands of the cruel mistress gravity.\medskip
Motivator becomes a sexy political pawn of the assassin's guild. He makes speeches with his dick out.\medskip
Sandi gives up her prized ancestral armour because she is too noticeable in it and instead follows in the footsteps of her idol Derek Bodacious and becomes a professional wrestler.\medskip
Back in "reality" the airship has landed in the sea and needs repairs. Vu Dong suffers from the butterfly effect and stops existing in this timeline. Burnie Sanders arrives on a boat tracking Pilch and reveals he faked his own death. Kolo and Exmeh are still remembering their other lives and try to kill him but Ru'Brex is old, wise and full of terminal disease and steps in to stop them saying that he could be useful.\medskip
The ship is stranded in the ocean and requires repairs. This is going to take a while, and it begins to snow. Winter has come. The gang wonder how Derek Bodacious is holding up back in Hope's Rest...
