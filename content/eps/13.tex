\subsection{Episode 13: Nobody Expects the...}
\DndDropCapLine{G}abrins down below, rock boy and dark one up above, drunky at the window.\medskip
Negotiations have failed, it’s fighting time.\medskip
Gary tries to calm the situation before waving his flower stick at them all. The auld sun seems to remind them all that it’s nap time, but not for a few hours yet.\medskip
Pilch chucks his sword into the fight, and darkens surrounds everyone.\medskip
Kolo and exmeh return to see if Gary has arrived yet, only to be met by a big ball of darkness.\medskip
The pastor rolls out of the back of the dark cloud and boom unloads into poor ikkle kolo.\medskip
Pilch decks one monk, and gary bashes another with his fancy branch.\medskip
Kolo is unconvincing, but the pastor is shooting blanks\medskip
Riphard shoots and dives through a pristine stain glass window, descending in a blaze of coloured glass. The slow mo is unbelievable!\medskip
Jeff gest confused and bashes his mate, poor old Jeff he was only 2 months from retirement.\medskip
Nobodies sees pilch flailing about, and exmeh is called late to the party, but not before the shady pastor lights kolo up, literally.\medskip
Gary does a pirorette, if anyone could see him they would know he was born to be a dancer.\medskip
Glowing kolo takes a good hard look at the pastor, before killing him. As he dies, the pastor says that “... they will come for you…”\medskip
Jeff gets WhippedHard! As the whip crack booms out enough thunder to send Jeff to his knees.\medskip
Gary tries to convince Jeffs mate that its time to stop all this tom-foolery, its not very effective, so he scarpers and then starts playing with a corpse somehow making it alive again.\medskip
Seeing the fight is almost over, Pilch gets nasty and starts cleaving the elders apart. He then sheaves his blade and the room returns to normal.\medskip
Gary goes round saving the elders and the shady pastor, unfortunately Jeff doesn’t make it. Retirement isn’t for everyone…\medskip
Pilch summons a freaky dark shadow wolf, while everyone else locks the doors and tries to fix up the window Riphard leapt through. (HowLove is born)\medskip
The party descends into the dark crypt, kolo takes the lead and stealthily gets covered in dust. Exmeh leads the now blind Gary around, until kolo gives him the hooded lamp.\medskip
We find a dozen set of childs bones of the floor.\medskip
Gabrins mount up and Gary leads the way… almost immediately we come across a small bound child that is emanating a new kind of evil\medskip
We find the womans child strung out on a stone, Gary tells everyone the stone is evil, Kolo protects him from evil causing the nasty glow from his eyes to receed. and we all agree to tie the kid too the marshall upstairs.\medskip
As the team turn around they are faced down by two giant armoured beasts, the silent and deadly knights who say ni! The knights charge in making a team sandwich, Riphard is stuck between a “Rock and a tard place”\medskip
Garys tries to 1v1 one of them and even though he fails, he succeeds. Riphard whips, fishy is dodgy, and the gabrins shoot. The first to knights get wrecked by the whole team, but not before a whole lot more of them, and some kind of master appears.\medskip
The guys fucks with kolos mind, and tries to control the whole party. Thanks to the mighty gary carrying us out we make it back to see the marshall again. Things are not looking good.\medskip
Kyross the kebab lady meets us back in the Cathedral, pilch casts darkness and similar to the old story he acts like the hero Philo, and tries to run away. Kolo is forced into telling the truth, he tells rather a lot of it. As Philo tries to jump the Kebab lady, she shoots him out of the sky. Thankfully Kolos truth bomb leads to a moment of truce.\medskip
After grilling us about certain stables, and then the Marshall on what was going on downstairs in his childrens sex dungeon, she decides to blow Fritzls head to pieces. She leaves the party in tact partly due to services rendered and then goes out to explain to the town about the how the church weren’t at fault.\medskip
The team comes up with a fool proof method of getting the real truth out by using the surviving child…\medskip
Riphard chats up the Arbiter Kyross about how she tracked us, and what should go forward from now. He doesn’t make a lot of headway, and Delilah gets seriously jealous.\medskip
Kolo briefly talks to Riphard about what he knows about the inquisition, it transpires that a member of them killed Riphard, and that he may/may not have been one of these children on the rock in the past
