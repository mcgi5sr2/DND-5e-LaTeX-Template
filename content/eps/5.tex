\subsection{Episode 5: Pitter Patter of Tiny Bears}

[The following pages are torn from a larger volume, and hastily rebound with string - One corner is singed implying someone attempted to burn this or the entire volume.\medskip
The writing is in a quick, hurried, but practised hand, and the type-face changes occasionally as though the writer grew bored of their style]\medskip
Codenames as follows...\medskip
- SH - Shadow Hound - Yours truly\medskip
- RP - Righteously Pissed - the drunken dwarf\medskip
- JR - Jilted Royal - the foreign lady\medskip
- SR - Shifty Rogue - the thieving goblin\medskip
- JM - Joyful Mechanic - the inventive goblin\medskip
\DndDropCapLine{S}o we’re in a cave, and just slaughtered a small number of small folk to whom we hope to ally. Great.
SR has initiated a plan to take over the small-peeps by killing Razzle, SH says we should try and discredit the small folks leader (Razzle) - Seems that the goblins and Dwarf are going to go in and try to convince everyone else that he’s gone rogue and isn’t part of the organisation anymore.\medskip
I’m loath to split the party, but the tiny bigots (...small-ots?) probably won’t like me or JR walking in - maybe we can be guards or sympathisers?\medskip
Anyway, I do the honorable thing of burning the bodies (and taking 5 ears), and then forging a document for RP -
"Razzle is accused of collusion against the SRA with his Ofecal Cherch Buziness."\medskip
We stop outside, and finalise the plan - is as above, but the goblins will go in shortly afterwards to make it seem they were (recently) ambushed.\medskip
RP Successfully enters the camp, thanks to the forged letter. The goblins sneak in after. RP manages to get found as an imposter, despite the letter. He did not know the secret Nichols handshake.\medskip
A fight breaks out between RP and 3 members of the SRA - but he’s quickly subdued.\medskip
Everyone decides to scapegoat RP as a church-worker, still to discredit Razzle. Goblins sneak in.\medskip
SRA becomes SRM - suddenly, because RP.\medskip
Goblins come in, pretending to be injured - leant huge credence by my amazing disguising. Two of the SRA fall for it.\medskip
RP gets blown up. Probably. Razzle likes bombs. “No dwarfy… I expect you to die!”\medskip
RP starts whipping people. He gets knocked out.\medskip
Team gobbo and 2 of the SRA run in. One gets blown up, the rest like Razzle more for this.\medskip
JR is very noisy, it messes up our stealthiness.\medskip
SH becomes a rock.\medskip
I get RP back up by punching him, and then dance like my life depends on it (which it did).\medskip
RP is then useful by disarming Razzle.\medskip
Razzle Shanks me, but the shadows protect.\medskip
The JM Blows off Razzles head.\medskip
SH, RP and JR (who had been doing pull-ups the whole time) leave.\medskip
The goblins appoint “Buttons” as the new leader of (this faction) of the SRA.\medskip
There's maybe 4 SRA left.\medskip
They also loot: Signet ring (with stampy well) 10 rockets 10gp\medskip
Papers - Bits of communication, Old Plans, Promotional Material, rambling letters,\medskip
I’m not happy about this.\medskip
We rest up.\medskip
Kolo and Otario have a heart to heart.\medskip
We all go to see Mae. JR takes point in the conversation. It’s interesting. Mae and Delilah plan with us to go kill fancy-pants.\medskip
I’m on a horse.\medskip
Mae gives us 3 people to go take on Fancy-Pants, Diago. One is an Battle-axe barbarian type, others a Crossbow-marksman, as is Delilah.\medskip
JR and JM also get fancy “dutty ho” boots.\medskip
On the way (to Diago) we encounter a man that tells us about the giant boar. Delilah flirts with RP for some reason.\medskip

JR - with her Mechanism Bow, JM and SR decide to attack at ranged, and take out the boar slowly.
In the forest, we get attacked by dropbears.\medskip
RP gets ripped hard. JR flails.\medskip
Me and the goblins kill nearly everything.\medskip
The crossbow whore (Martha) dies.\medskip
I save RP.\medskip
I get Martha’s Xbow.\medskip
Wait, shit… I better burn these pages - safer than leaving a paper trail...
