\subsection{Episode 17: Hopes Rest}
\DndDropCapLine{T}he bird people may have a caste system, but luckily we will tell the little birdies all about emancipation and the great Stanri story. That will be sure to sort it all out.\medskip
I must now lead my lovely lovely party through the desert, it is very hot in the day but luckily we are travelling at night, and Fishy has been looking out for my spiny bush.\medskip
After a few days we emerge 100\% on the North side, but maybe not exactly anywhere in particular.\medskip
Fishy starts eating grass, everyone is slightly bemused but what can you do about a dark and stormy emo??\medskip
I take a power nap while Gary gets the map in order and leads us into the next chapter of our adventure….\medskip
Transpires Fishy got shot in the city recently. But we travel on regardless, until we spy a lovely new road. Its the main drag between Port Averdale and Hopes Rest. Lovely smooth cobbles. I go off looking for more leaves and roots and herbs and things. I clearly need some more. I deliver my great finds to Exmerah, she seems very pleased.\medskip
Wagons roll we are off again, until we come across the classic dead horses in the road ambush! Reminds me of an old trick we used to use in the North.\medskip
Luckily there is a sitting duck or little girl out as bait. Gary goes to investigate her, she seems safe, Gary is like a nurturing parent.\medskip
Riphard goes to investigate the horses, seems they are indeed dead.\medskip
While everyone is distracted I procure some necessities from the carriage. Or I would have if the shitty carriage wasn’t empty! At least empty of anything worth re-purposing.\medskip
There is something definitely shifty about this young girl. Gary seems smitten with the little girl, going so far as to give her the Gary Guarantee.\medskip
Pilch takes me for an aside chat, his Gabrin is awful. His chat is all potato this potato that, Exmeh is very disappointed. The long and short of it is we are off to find the parents.\medskip
I find a set of three tracks pretty deep, no doubt the parents were carried off here. The signs here don’t look good, it almost certain in my mind that there people are dead. Real pros at kidnapping wouldn’t leave the child behind, or the horses and cart dead in the road like that. I doubt we even need to be careful these guys are amateurs.\medskip
Riphard is keen to kill the parents. He is a strange one. 15\% likelihood we will kill there parents apparently.\medskip
Despite the long talks making everyone seem tactically inept, as I slip into the shadows to investigate with Exmerah, the others take up decent positions in the cave mouth.\medskip
Fishy and Riphard are stalking us.\medskip
There are strange skinny humanoids skulking about in here. I am not keen on it at all, and in the darkness I am starting to regret doubling my dose on the leaves. Its always the darkness where the shapes start, pretty green fireflys that dance out at me. And swarm around a small grey skinned creature… its a friggin thing that a caravan creeps were talking about! Those changelings!!!! Sounds like Gary is paying the price for befriending that little freaky girll.\medskip
Its murder time, so I smash a mervyn special into the back of the little creep. I manage to get two shots off before things go south. They are swarming onto me, and making horrid sounds! I let fly the bird and shout for Riphard as backup. Slashing me open with their horrid scythe hands!\medskip
Gary goes old school and suplexes the little bitch. We all know she had it coming. Riphard tries to finish the job, but the mustard isn’t ready for cutting yet.\medskip
First freaky silver changeling goes down, as Pilch jumps in to save me, I never knew he cared! Its time to play shoot and boot, classic Gabrin tactic of hit and run. Exmerah knows it as shoot and scoot.\medskip
Gary engages brain, and tries to get the creature to spill the beans on where the cart owners actually are. Riphard goes to blow its brains out, but restrains himself, maybe he still feels soft for the kids.\medskip
I got Pilchys back, and as he soaks up the changelings I nail some more shots into them with Exmerah! Pilchy really moving and shaking for the team here. He is also giving off a lovely cool breeze.\medskip
Gary nails the poor childs head into the ground, but plants firmly into the ground. The changling then gives him some tonguey action. This gives Riphard the opportunity he must have been waiting for, as he unloads some blessed loving straight into the creature.\medskip
Gary gets up and chips the creature into the air, Riphard can’t hit the moving target though.Gary finally gets the jobs done.\medskip
The changlings only become small creatures as we were all told in an awesome bit of foreshadowing!! ! !\medskip
Having set fire to the old carriage and dissected their horses we make our way onto the city. Coming in from the east. This city is MASSIVE !\medskip
Exmerah has made us awesome clothes, including a knocka backa for hitting the poor.\medskip
City is broken up into its Guilds from the old families of the city.\medskip
Each family selects a board that selects a GEO Guild Executive Officer that rules the area.\medskip
Parchet green (half elf) male quite stern, and ruthless. All who stood against him in elections have vanished.\medskip
The five families have guilds underneath them,\medskip
Life = taverns, gambling,\\
Might = Archers, mercenaries, masters elite unit, the hunt (bounty hunters for beasts)\\
Coin = traders, stores, market, and mint\\
Service = cleaners, valets, plumbers, Jennies (semi official), Theives Guild, Assasins Guild\\
Making = carpenters, builders, blacksmiths, clothiers etc\\
River Eldon flows through the middle. The areas have power over the sections of the town, but also the guild members who live outside of the guild area.\medskip
Politics area is around the Guild Hall.\medskip
Bertrands stand is the last defensive wall.\medskip
Gary is now call Jaygo and has an awful voice\\
Kolo is now lord Olok\\
Exmeh is now Lady Haremxe\\
Riphard is now TornSoft\\
Pilch is Papa Lazarizz\medskip
We come across the petite ferret inn. Where a haughty Gnome is here to help us out.\medskip
Papa Lazarizz is most efficient at representing our needs.\medskip
Papa Lizz is outta control, and has to be forcibly removed by the managements staff. Turns out that no one is that interested in buying his sword.\medskip
The SRA are reprobates I couldn’t agree more.\medskip
We need to arrange, a meeting with the correct guild, and the correct paperwork.\medskip
Gnome is Horatio BrambleThrust, is going to hook us up for a weeks stay, and help us with applications etc.\medskip
Gary is now a member of the Rustlers…..\medskip
Papa Lizz gets a visit from the work force to get the 50 Gold. The bouncers seem very reasonable, when asking for payment. Unfortunately he books it.\medskip
Gary follows suit by jumping out the window to find Fishy, possible he is totally hammered. The chase is on. Pilch has escaped in a taxi cab, and Gary is hot on his heels They meet up in an abandoned building, where they meet Archibald the librarian for the book burners. The book burners have all run away, as they have been hunted down by mercenaries? Amazingly the library has been left untouched. The Church have had no contact. Lillian another book burner has been round about two months ago, she is a half elf book burner that actually liked fishy. She has travelled West.\medskip
Its pretty unclear what Archibald has been eating. Pilch crosses the mans hand with silver.\medskip
One last dream sequence with Lazarus,\medskip
Get leads on church secrets, make money, make a base. Same old story.\medskip
Pilch says we should Register as mercenaries. He has had worse ideas.
