\subsection{Episode 24: The Brightest Flame Casts the Darkest Shadow}
\DndDropCapLine{W}ell dear diary, I never thought I’d see the day when a big boat came my way. But that is in fact exactly what today is. Boat day. It is a lovely boat and is made all of wood and has a front and a back and both sides too. It has been a few sea days (same as land days) since Captain McCaw (parrot man) took us to sea from Port Averdale. Gosh I still remember how scary it was when those crazy inquisitors managed to almost catch me. The seas have been very calm and Kolo says Pilchard is having lots of fun with all the semen. Gary has been learning lots of naughty words and helping out around the boat. Kolo has not been well. Even though the sea has been very calm he has been very sick and stayed in his bunk most days. After a few weeks we came across a curious little island that is also a supply post where the captain has lots of friends. Kolo is happy to be on land again. We had an evocative and minimal day there apparently but it was over so very quickly. Gary was asking me about where the sea came from. Kolo usually tells this story but he seemed to be very very distracted about something in the distance. It was only Dark Elf Raiders!!! They were closing fast underneath the mid day sun and captains feathers were visibly raised. Fishy tried to cast darkness and he said that as he did it he saw them push a big ball into the water. Gary was trying to be a good host and decided that he would make tea for the new guests and demanded the good china. I didn’t really think this was a good idea but I didn’t want to be rude so I stayed quiet. Then they were attacking! Kolo decided to wake up properly and the game was on. They are slavers. One of the ladies swung across onto the boat with both hands full that was very impressive and oh my gosh did she hit him hard. I have not seem him wince that much since last night when I accidentally walked in on him and 6 of the crew’s finest doing some kind of odd conga line without their leg clothes on. The lady shouted over to the other boat in an odd language that no-one could really understand. It sounded naggy. Two of them swunged over to our boatsey and kolo and I did a super cool double twin funship time double shot. I think I misunderstood because Kolo did a funny shoot through the rope and the man hung in mid air for a minute and looked shot then fell into the sea in a funny way, and mine shoot just went through his left eye, travelled through his cranial cavity and emerging through the base of his skull where the spine connects. He fell into the sea so I don’t know if he lived but if he does I suspect he won’t be able to walk anymore or remember basic facts like how to toilet. Omg there was like a crabby thing climbing up the boat as well and it did not look like a friendly crab like the one in the petting zoo in the city. Fishy died for a little bit. A lot of the sailors looked very sad and frustrated with this development. Gary threw the captain lady off the ship because of her rude manners. In his success he turned back to the crab and told it not to “you try anything missy”. The crab responded by grabbing his head with it’s giant claw. I tried to shoot it but it was so scary. Kolo was a big hero and went to help Fishy by giving him one of his special medicines. Fishy awoke and blurrily looked around him. I am sure he is grateful. Gary woke up and found himself all stuck in the clause of the crab. I shooted the crab and threw an electricity blanket to fishy. The pesky elves kept shooting at me and kolo’s bodies. It was not going so well today, lots and lots of people everywhere and I kid you not even one little bit diary, not even one sailor helped us at all. Not even the captain birdy. Kolo was on fire though, his arrow was quite literally the most arrow arrow I have ever seen. But oh my gosh, then kolo seemed to waiver and he fell down onto the deck! The doggy killed the captain lady in a very gratuitous way and she died horribly. Then Fishy didn’t even try to save kolo even though kolo helped him. Not cool. Gary managed to escape from the clutches of the claws but then it climbed up onto the boat. Then the other two elves of colour jumped over (it was actually dazzling how graceful they are). Howlydog urinated onto kolo to try and wake him up. It was all starting to look hectic and they were closing in all around us, backs to the boat neck, and I kid you not Gary actually had a little nap!! Right there on the boat floor. He woke up getting hugged by crabby. Then he looked tired again. Omg this one guy just keeps following me and will not die. \#needy. I think everyone else wasfighting crabby. Thankfully kolo managed to kill my unwanted friend. By the time I got over there gary and fishy were just flying around in the arms of the crab. Fishy did some odd thing where he turned into a shadow cloud and then the doggy turned into ash and the birdy squarked and popped into feathers. “This is not the time for this” I thought to myself. Kolo put the crabby down with a scream of fury, yelling about the fishy, the arrow travelling through Fishy’s odd gas cloud. Goo just fell out of the crabby and it just fell into segments then fell to the boat floor, dead. That was quite a fight, all the crew looked like they were quite shook up (even though I don’t think I saw them fighting that much). We went over to the other boat and looted it and we got lots of money (that I held onto because Gary doesn’t have pockets and kolo seems to lose his money and Fishy is a cloud). Gary decided that we should take the other boat because it was too dangerous for people to be near us. He leant us some sailors, and I think I can handle what is essentially a piece of cloth and the wind. We spent some time looking for fishy. He had to be here somewhere. It was very odd that he was gone for so long. Usually he is around to say something stupid. Gary and Kolo had a little secret talk while I looked for Fishy. Gary looked shocked. I decided to try and see if my little magic detector could find him but it was clearly being broken because it was saying that it couldn’t even find anything. This really wasn’y funny and I was going to be very very cross with fishy when he turned up. Kolo was painting Fishy’s name onto the boat and that wasn’t even a good idea. They wanted to go on the boat and leave without fishy and that was a really stupid idea I do have to say because Fishy was not even back yet and Kolo and Gary wanted to just go and leave without fishy and that was a stupid idea and I told them that even and th……………………… …………. ……………… Storms. Dreams nightmares of storms. Everything is raging. Everything is black smoke and screams and semen ………………….. [Gary wakes up and notices that there is a large tattoo on his chest. Gary knows that this is the sign of his eternal shame and decides that it must stay hidden. I believe Kolo and Gary drugged me. I woke up groggy headed in an unfamiliar apple crate. The mood was low and I refused to talk to anyone. Everyone was quite. A month passed. I spent every day fixing up the ship and every night sat in the crows nest watching out for fishy and working on fishy’s present for when he gets back even though I am cross with him for hiding so long. I think it is clear now Pilch is not coming back. Kolo says that is correct. I went to the back of the ship and looked out at the dark sea with the moon shining bright over the calm stillness. I worked so hard on this arm shield for him. And he was the human I hated the least. This is not fair. We arrived shortly after in XXXXXXX a curious jungle town and port. The people all wore little jungle outfits made of grass and stuff and everyone was a human of colour like me. It made me uncomfortable and I held onto my coin pouch a little tighter as we walked around. Gosh it is hot as well. Our two sailors, Kev and his brother Archibald, whose parents couldn’t decide on posh names or common names so chose both. They decided to keep the boat safe and fix it up for our getaway. I looked over at the gleaming beaches and lovely sunlight but it just filled me with a sense of sadness. But saying that, they do have pappyas and mangoes which are actually quite nice. Once we got into town Gary went emotionally shadwoy and went to stand on a cliff. It seemed to me a lot like that was not a good move, so we went to take some pappyas to gary and I decided it would be a good idea to eat them in front of him to cheer him up. I told him about how delicious it was and showed him how well I could eat, and that it could be shampoo but we both agreed we have no hair so we should just eat it. He gave a little half smile, and Kolo gave him some drops of liquid and they looked out at the sunset. We felt riphard’s presence, and wondered what he was doing. I imagine he has made a pool of gold by now and spends his days diving into it and swimming and playing with his nephews. Gary felt renewed in the morning it seemed. He told us the mission was important and that he thought he had failed. But I was still asleep and tired because I had literally what seemed like 1000 hours of pappya fuelled nightmares. Oh my gosh it was so horrible. I dreamt I was sat in an room full of humans in fancy shirts and they were all looking at glowing boxes, and one of them came over and said “Are you coming to the 2:30 meeting Jonathan” and I didn’t want to but they gave me money. I was so bored all I wanted to do was eat more pappya and pretend to be me with other people who looked at shiny boxes. And there was always wine every night and self loathing and meals that seemed to be nicer in your head before you made them but were then actually really disappointing and you promise yourself never to buy fish from Morris’ son ever again and you should eat sanes berries again. Gary and Kolo were on it and told us what we needed to do. Kolo decied to raise our spirits by drinking spirits. O M G The drinks had little umbrellas in them! The nice dark skinned man called me pretty and I giggled a little but made sure to hold my coin purse tighter. I suspect that the umbrellas are to protect against rain. Kolo engaged the darkened man and asked about the wild animals which I thought was a bit on the nose given the circumstances. He seemed not to notice and told us about the jungle. “Nature owns the jungle”. Kolo pointed out that nature owns the entire world. Kolo talked to the same man who was now stood somewhere else. He told us that outsiders never return from the jungle, and told us that the plants are thick and pathways difficult. It seemed odd to me that there were pathways in the jungle. He kept saying indabush which who knows what that means. I ordered every pappya drink. I ordered all 3 and drank them and oh my gosh they were delicious. Kolo talked to the man about his people who lived in the jungle. He says no man would be crazy enough to guide us. Gary asked about legends and small cubes. He says he has not heard and that most of the legends are of the great beasts that all had stupid names. He told us we had to travel south from the oasis across the rope bridge then east to the temple. Gary wondered off and I ordered seven of each to go. Gary went up to a shop and asked for all the jungle kit. We got machetes, water canteens, sturdy boots, dried rations, towels. Somehow the man behind the bar had got to the shop before me. How could he be so fast? Gary started acting very odd. He collapsed to his knees and looked panicked. I tried to help him breathe but oh gosh there was a black dust that just came out everywhere, and then even what happened was that like a goldy smoke came out into the air then vanished and then gary collapsed onto his face on the floor and the ground shook. Kolo and I tried to see what was wrong. We cut off his mumu and you would not even believe one bit that there was a glowing sigil all glowing gold on his chest and it was beautiful and it was Pilch’s sign! His chest was all cracking and light was spilling out. And then he was almost sick everywhere but then just gold came out and it made a shape in the air and then just disappeared. I think Kolo must have given him something odd. The bar man looked shocked. Then was a little voice that just said “hey how are you doing?”. There was a small figure just behind him all in gold with a long hat of gold. Is this Gary’s son? He looked moist. The man was inside him and he has an odd accent. He doesn’t even know what year it is. The man said his name was Mark. Then he started talking to us in our heads which seemed like a big violation of our privacy. The man claims that he was the mark that was on pilch’s arm. He latched onto gary when pilch died because he was the closest. He came down from the heavens eons ago when divine power was more stable upon the earth and was meant to prevent the sundering, and he is short because divine power has dwindled and he is hemorrhaging his essence. He got bound into a book. Gary decided it was time to live up to his responsibilities and addressed his son directly. I asked if he had a mark of synne too but he just took his clothes off and I had to cover my eyes and apparently kolo says he had little horns. I am a little convinced that Kolo may have put something in my drink. Kolo challenged him on his claims. The man claimed to actually be a god. Or at least an avatar. I asked for proof because guy was mental crazy. Gary asked his son to go to all the vendors and find the lowest price he could for a small vial that contained one grain of sand from each colour of the rainbow. He went to find a gullible sand vendor. He made the sand by magic. Gary was a strict father and made him go away and do it again properly. He walked off and played with his hat. Gary consulted us. Gary seems to think either he doesnt mean us no harm or he is not powerful enough to harm us, either way he is no immediate threat. I was worried that his shiny suit would draw panthers to us but kolo points out that it would draw them to him. I asked Gary who the mother was. Gary started talking about the naughty thing people do sometimes to make children so I left and looked at mark. He showed me a butterfly. He seemed scared of it. Gary and Kolo decided that Pilch must have been the mother. Gary embraced Mark and greeted him as his son and told him about his mother Pilch. Gary asked his son about the Cube O’Rubriks. He knew that it was deep in the jungle which did not seem immediately helpful. I sneaked a quick drink of the pappya mojito while no-one was looking. Rubriks was a powerful magician and had lairs and hid stuff so that seems to make everything more difficult. Gary’s son implores his father to teach him bodily functions. We prepared for our journey, bolstered by new friends. End credits: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZInRE-KryGA The gang sit on the beach sipping pappya drinks whilst looking out at the sunset, lay out on sunbeds. The goblins watch as Gary and Mark attempt to play catch with a coconut but neither really seems to be grasping the fundamental basics of the game. They basically just throw it at eachothers faces and laugh but seem to be enjoying eachothers company. Kolo and Exme clink their drinks together and settle back in their chairs. Exme looks down to the beach and sees the shadow of her seat, and for a moment she sees the grunting face of Pilch as ghost sailors ram him. He gives her a little smile before going back to wincing from a particularly brutal thrust. Exme smiles and leans back to settle into a night of pappya-induced office-based nightmares.
