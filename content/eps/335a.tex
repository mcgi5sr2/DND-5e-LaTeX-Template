\DndDropCapLine{C}ase File \#244401: The Printing Press Incident - Section 1\medskip
The new recruits were found asleep during their final exams. This was only to be expected, as the quality of intake hit a new low during the last quarter.\medskip
Due to the minimal pass requirement brought in recently, they don’t need to actually score any points, which is lucky, so Officer Sanders informs them all that, barring any catastrophes, they’re all fully qualified Book Burners. The invigilator, Book Burner Tyrone, had also been unconscious, which has been noted on his file. As he is only 2 days from retirement, and a bird person, this is not anticipated to form the basis of a formal enquiry.\medskip
As is tradition, the new recruits were first given the task of physically abusing Book Burner Garmond. This report notes, with professional detachment, that they wiped that sickening smirk off the gits face, with minimal effort.\medskip
With this achieved, they were sent to their quarters, to be given their first full assignment in the morning. Prospective Book Burner “Bones” was observed creepily watching the other applicants sleep. Prospective Book Burner “Sandi” was observed staggering home with two kebabs of questionable origin.\medskip
Come morning, at regulation waking hour, the recruits were given their assignment. They were to locate a printing press, which had reportedly been used to produce illicit material, distributed widely throughout Hope's Rest.\medskip
Book Burner Tyrone had been provided with a full briefing package containing intelligence as to the likely location of the instrument in question. This report notes that the breakable seal on the briefing package was unbroken as of last inspection.\medskip
The prospective Book Burners were observed near of the entrance of the Guild Hall, discussing where to begin their search for the item. For reasons unknown, many of the recruits were under the impression that the press would be likely to be located in close proximity to the River Elden.\medskip
En route to the location they had determined was most likely to contain the press - which happened to be a public house - the group were beset by wealth engineers of the Thieves Guild.\medskip
With great motivational prowess, Prospective Book Burner Codename "Mr Motivator" encouraged the Thieves Guild operatives to leave and join the Shmeves guild. The group also found that the printing press had a drop off point just around the corner and if they waited they would be able to follow.\medskip
During the ensuing time, Sandi hid in a barrel while Mr Motivator hid himself by starting a running club. "Bones" on the other hand hid in an alleyway, attempting to entice people to come visit him. He succeeded in attracting a little blonde girl who immediately disappeared.\medskip
In a completely unrelated sequence of events "Bones" brought the cook Martha some delicious unadulterated child meat, which Martha immediately turned into a delicious stew to sell to the hungry passers by in Motivators book club.\medskip
After continuing shennanigans the group managed to find the person making the drop and follow them into the sewers. Down in the sewers they found that people were reading newspapers which were brainwashing them and turning them into mindless zombies. Though not zombies, because zombies obviously don't exist, but metaphorical zombies.\medskip
The team valiently killed and burned the civilians who they could have helped.\medskip
Back on the airship - the main party are all in some form of machine created by Mark - he explains there has been a freak magic storm which was going to destroy the ship and he has created the machine to siphon off the magical energy any protect everyone. At the same time, they are able to use the magical energy to inhabit the lives of other people in the past .
