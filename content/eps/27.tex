\section{Episode 27: Making New Friends is Fun but Losing Mark is Funner}

\DndDropCapLine{D}ear Diary.\medskip

All is death. All is pain. Why must all our friends leave us? For a little while everything seemed like it was going so well. Life seemed kind, yet as soon as she hinted at that promise of hope and friendship she ripped it away. First Pilcheur was robbed away from us by the 8 seas. And now….. He was the bravest goblin that ever lived. He was everything the stories told of and more. And now he has gone, like tears in rain. Why has this happened? Why?\medskip

Two Months earlier: Riphard sits on a sunlounger in a drizzly night, ordering whisky from no-one in particular and questioning his life. It had been a month of banking, drinking and ordering about Exme and Kolo’s workers. Derek bodacious had travelled up to start his billboard campaign. “We take interest in your interest”. His squeeze Delilah had been gone seeing the Jennies but she remained tight lipped about that business. She sounds a lot posher than before. Riphard cannot live without her. Delilah points out sometimes they will need to go to the shops. Riphard clarifies that he can live 48 hours/2 days without her. The romance is retained. And Riphard proposes making her the happiest whore in the world. (A thousand miles away Pilch’s testicles are crushed as a sea monster pierces his heart through his perineum). Riphard feels the world is a little better. Riphard is so chuffed he feels physically more developed and nubile. It took a long time. Too long. Very long. Pasta was not chinese? Spelled up to the tits mate. To the tits. Riphard held Delilah tight to him but a knock at the door broke him away. It was Arbiter Kiros and some small plate armoured man. Having an ex-possibility turn up was not part of the special day. Riphard was confused by Arbiter Smordnuron (Myron?). The two new visitors entered hurriedly. Kiros gave a long look at the rigid and tearful Deliliah. Kiros had troubling news from her friend. Myron explained that he had been made aware of a young man up in the country who was suffering from a spell of seeing things and sought Riphard’s advice. The visions showed a grey man turning into gravel and/or a tree. A rescue mission was proposed with the caveat that it seemed ‘dodgy as fuck’. Riphard did not seem concerned. Lines of dried Koka Kola and his whore-to-be-wife and gold beckoned. Flint and Jiznak suddenly came down the firemans pole. Jiznak could not help but overhearin that they wanted to travel. He was not spying. He explained that they had been constructing a device for Lady Haramxe that might help them get there quicker. Jiznak has an invisible brother who speaks to him. This was not mentioned in the interview. He decided that it was probably easier to show them what he was talking about. The group travelled upstairs. An 8 ft long and 4 ft wide wicker basket full of supplies sat on the roof, tied to a number of metal wires and a large sheet. Riphard got it right away. Jiznak also handed Riphard a two hand sized device that had an antenna on top that had a screen on the front that was able to track Starni that Exme had previously poopooed. Riphard and Delilah had a brief argument about who should fly the machine. It was always Delilah’s life-dream. Riphard didn’t give a fuck. The argument seemed like a stale mate. Myron said that Delilah was driving. Riphard sulked and said he wouldn’t come. They decided to split it. Flint Barrymore is Italian. He points out that an extra crate has been added for Exme. Myron is worried about dying. Jiznak inflated the balloon to which Riphard took offence. As they flew away Jiznak screamed “By the way we’ve been having some problems with stopping it”. AND THEY WERE OFF….\medskip

We woke up from little sleep, the tears still fresh on my face. For a brief moment as I awoke I thought I saw Gary sleeping next to me, but it was just a normal rock. Kolo was staring at the sky. It seemed like more terrordactyls were on the way. As it got closer I realised it it was a Jiznak “special” including no brakes. Goodness me it was coming in fast. As it got closer an odd man was hanging off the basket and dragged his heels along the side of the temple, slowing it a little but oh god it was coming in fast. It basically imploded all over Mark. What a mess. As the wreckage cleared, I could make out the image of Riphard, rolling out of the carnage with Delilah in tow. The strange new man came up to the top of the stairs and looked at us. He said “It’s all true isn’t it?”. I couldn’t believe they were here. Hours. Just hours. If they had been here a little quicker he wouldn’t have died. I couldn’t stop crying. The odd new man introduced himself as Arbiter Myron. He seemed to have been misled and decided that he was going to join us. Kolo and Myron had a discussion about devils. Myron seemed to be learning alot about how the world really worked. Mark introduced himself in an annoying way and confirmed all of Myron’s worst fears about how the world worked. Mark told everyone he wanted to talk to Lazarus. Marke described himself as Sin’s pinky finger/moose knuckle. Riphard couldn’t really understand. Myron didn’t have half a thumb on his right hand. I was quite craving Koka Kola. Oh god how I wanted it so bad. Kolo gave me two and I put them both into my papya drink. I drank deeply and felt the shivering stop. It felt lovely after all the pain. Sooo sl..ee...py……\medskip

We woke up in front of stupid Lazarus’s desk. Thankfully Meredith had tea and she sounded quite funny with her trunk. Mark seemed upset about how she had stood him up at Prom for Brad. He says he can’t quit that woman. Myron looked incredibly confused. Myron seemed to have a lot of lip for someone he had only just met. Lazarus seemed happy to see Mark again. Also, he looked very different and a bit more emaciated. He had all these little frays of light about him. They had a dick waving contest about who had let more people die. Omg Mark just slapped Lazurus right in the face. He just gave Mark a toothy grin and then backhanded him into the wall. It was almost sad how devastating it was. Lazarus looked through his rhyming documents to find Myron’s documents. Myron offered his help to Lazarus in a funny voice like those people that work in the dirty streets back in the city and dig black rock and eat pies. Lazarus pointed out that Myron’s whole life picking berries and helping people was actually not so good and he said that Myron was a sinner. Myron asked about how much of a sinner he was and Lazurus flicked through a lot of papers looking more shocked the more he read. I got the impression that Myron was not going to have a good afterlife. I asked Lazarus as nicely as I could if he could bring Gary back to life. He said no, not like us. But, he said Gary was different. Gary would actually probably come back to life in a few hundred years. I… this is incredible. We’ll never see him again but, it brings me hope that Gary will walk the planet once again to bring little goblins joy once more. Gary will live on.\medskip

Lazarus told Myron about how we had to take down the church and destroy the gods. Myron was basically all for it and accepted it very easily even the whole sunburning thing that I still don’t really understand. Kolo got a good dig in about Pilch and Gary. Lazarus decided he would not be insulted all day and he and Riphard had a moment. Mark tried to ask for Meredith’s number but then we all woke up.\medskip

Mark was complaining about how he did not have a nanka. He said we had all been touched but that never even happened to me. Mother brought me up proper. Everyone had a bit of a natter looking around what was going on outside. I explained to everyone that the magic field in this temple was off the charts and we should honour Gary’s temporary sacrifice by find the Die of Rubrix. Myron headed down, very keen indeed. As we went downstairs, we came face to face with Gary’s tree. It looked so precious and beautiful. I could smell again and I noticed the vivid smell of rocks everywhere. Riphard looked weak. Myron started looking wildly around. Riphard didn’t look well at all and I asked him if he wanted to sit down. I followed Kolo into the room that Gary was subdued in. Kolo had already found a secret door inside the room and he asked me to go get everyone. Kolo said he found many many riches in the room to the tune of 5000 gp. One was a beautiful tiara that Kolo put on me. We went to get everyone else after making sure to hide it all in bagsy (shhhh don’t tell anyone). Kolo asked Riphard about how the banking has been going. It has been going well. Riphard pointed out that he was excited about his new forestry initiative. There was some confusion about whether trees grow or if they don’t like lemons. Myron told us a story about a town where some people had stolen lemons and then sold them back to the town and everyone laughed nervously but then he said a load of homeless people had been tried and hung for the crime. That was a little bit awkward I will admit. Kolo asked me to help Riphard out a little bit *wink *wink. I tried to shake his hand many times but he kept just scrunching his hand up in a ball and pushing it against mine. I gave it to Delilah instead who decided that prenups were suddenly a VERY good idea. Oh wells\medskip

We headed downstairs and kolo did a sneaky sneak to go and look ahead. Mark went off South running away from me for some reason. Well it might not have been me but I took it personally. There was a sad sound of a falling body so I imagine he died. No-one really cared so we tried our look with new friend Myron. I noticed how short Myron was for the first time. All dark skinned and Grey and wrinkled. His tattered orangeish brownish coat sat on top of his plate armour, more finely crafted than I would personally expect from the rest of his clothed. And my what a gun, so complicated. What does it even do? I can’t really understand how it works given that the top pivot was just fixed in place but it did look cool. And he’s very dark….\medskip

We headed into the fight Myron leading the way very bravely. Kolo and I followed behind. The room was full of all types of tikki-tukk ©. He put down his shield in the doorway and stood bravely. They screamed “By fire, wind and ice, we will take them for sacrifice”. His shield seemed to get all hot after a TikkiTuk © shouted out some words and Myron looked really hot. All these brambles came up around my legs but I just shrugged them off because they was just plantsies. Kolo was all wrapped up but he was still able to do a killing bow because he is ace. I shot one and then the two normal ones ran at Myron. The first tikki-tukk © got impaled on his bayonet. Then I saw one of the coolest things i have ever even seen. He used the momentum of the dead body to reload his gun and then shot straight through the corpse into the next tikki-tuk ©. It was amazeballs. As we moved into the room we saw that there was an odd little monkey man all tied up looking like a sacrifice. We all tried to come into the room but there was some giant almost-wall like thing of wind. Myron ran straight through it fearlessly but it didn’t look so easy. Kolo tried to shoot through it and what a shot but the arrow just splintered in the wind. Myron fought them on the other side and somehow the man-monkey wormed his way free and started fighting those guys too. Gosh he can move fast. He hit one guy who started making lightning but as he did that the wind wall dropped and I managed to kill him with a kaboom.\medskip

Myron seemed to relax after the fight and offered us round some delicious beef jerky. Really salty, and a good texture. Cured almost to the exact ri…. Mark re-appeared. I rolled my eyes. I pointed out to him that he was never really here when we need him and he said he wasn’t really the fighting type. He started flickering and through the garbled words he looked at the monkey-man and sometimes he didn’t have a leg and sometimes his legs were walking backwards while he was standing still and then suddenly he just jumped into the man-monkey…. This can’t be good news. I considered killing the monkey-man for a moment but I decided the risk of Mark surviving was too high so I decided to let him live. I wonder if the monkey-man will be our friend?\medskip

\textbf{Epilogue: Year 1657 - The Other World Prom Night}\medskip

A young Mark checks how his golden hat is sitting in the reflection of his golden shoes. It’s looking good and Mark knows it. He gives himself a toothy grin and heads towards the front door of a small suburban house. All the full nightmare terrors of hell swim and swarm through the blackened sky above the tasteful 2 bedroom bungalow and child-like elephants wave at him as they play on a swing in the garden that is pushed by the souls of the dead. Mark knocks on the door and gives himself a little arm-rub for luck. The door opens and a surly, elderly elephant man with a pipe answers. The elphant man is dressed in a sweater, slacks and slippers and holds a newspaper under his arm. His trunk flares as he surveys the small golden man in front of him. “How are ye doing sir?”, says Mark with a misplaced enthusiasm. The elephant man grunts. “I’m here to pick up Meredith for the prom”. The elderly elephant chuckles and his trunk lets out a short trumpet. “What de ye mean Brad?”, asks a stunned Mark. The elephant man’s eyes go wide and his mouth curls into a grin. “Brahhh prahh pruurum aprpprp” he mockingly replies. “But that cant be right sir. Ye daughter promised she’d be going with me”. The elephant man’s wife appears wearing curlers stuck to the top of her elephant head and she asks her husband a questions, “hruumph pumphhh rrrmp?”. The man replies, “grummppp frrrp tummp”. They both start laughing in an elephantlike way and the man slams the door in Mark’s face. Mark is shocked and looks down at the now wilting flower that he had bought for his beloved. As he turns to walk away he sees Meredith in the passenger seat of Brad’s Corvette. The two are laughing and driving away. Mark pauses for a moment and says “Well…. Who’d have trunk?” GIANT GRIN TO CAMERA - EXTREME ZOOM IN - PAUSE ON GRIN - MUSIC PLAYS \medskip
