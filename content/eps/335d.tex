\subsection{Episode 33.75: Bobacious Takes On Chrismas}
\DndDropCapLine{T}he session opens with a fantastic poem that I am too slow at typing.\medskip
There is some confusion over Derek Bobacious’ name. But it’s definitely Bobacious with a B. None of that D shit.\medskip
Derek is drinking brandy. G’arbigail comes in after hunting.\medskip
G’abby talks about the small points of portmanteau.\medskip
G’Applesauce has a stupid name he’s trying to fix. He sucks by self admission.\medskip
Ghenri stands for things he doesnt know what they mean and berates Gappy\medskip
Gerald is there.\medskip
Mr GBonko is also there.\medskip
Derek says there’s a problem for the Gary guild. The guild of Chrismas exists. This is bad.\medskip
Gabby slams her hand on the table for funsies.\medskip
Derek says the Gary’s need a monopoly on name based guilds. He says that today is Chrismas Eve, making tomorrow Chrismas.\medskip
Gabby says giving gifts for free is to deny the right to earn it. Preventing them from their sense of pride and accomplishment.\medskip
Derek questions whether people like heroism more than free shit. People value leadership. Knowing theyre worth less than their betters.\medskip
Ghenri suggests poisoning the Chrismas guild.\medskip
Derek counts slowly and demands an end to Chrismas.\medskip
Derek suggests stopping present production and crashing the Jennys ball, making sure it is a disaster as it is Chrismas themed. We need to find out who the leader of Chrismas guild is and take them down.\medskip
GBonko is interested in the toys. His business was ruined by the devaluing of the toy market.\medskip
There is more discussion over whether pure free market capitalism or free toys makes society better.\medskip
Derek discusses why the most powerful Gary isn’t called Gary.\medskip
GEric is the lone person arguing for kindness and happiness for all. Disgusting.\medskip
Derek suggests unconvincingly less murdering is better for the Garys image.\medskip
GBonko asks for some secret payment from Derek who graciously obliges.\medskip
Gabby wants to hand out pamplets questioning what the purpose of the Garys is. Seriously. What is it? We want to know.\medskip
GBonko spouts some anti Gary shit. GHenri questions why he’s even here. Gabby says we should leave rather than listen to GBonko.\medskip
GBonko blames the orcs for the downfall of his business.\medskip
Cut to a warehouse. Bustling toy-making noises emanate from within. It’s in a basement with 1 entrance. Fire regulations beings ignored clearly.\medskip
Geric knocks on the door, and a rude man answers through a shutter.\medskip
Geric explains we’re here from the Gary guild, but Gabby talks smack and says we’re here to fuck them up.\medskip
Geric says we just want to talk about Chrismas.\medskip
Ghenri tries the old inspector routine to no avail.\medskip
Geric gets frustrated at the rude door man and gobby Gabby. GBonko still questions who Gary is.\medskip
Ghenri readies a fire arrow. GBonko pours a questionable liquid onto the arrow in attempt to put it out.\medskip
Geric and Gappy knock on the door again. The rude man answers again, ignoring Geric.\medskip
Gappy pretends to be Crapplesauce and gets us in the door.\medskip
Geric puts the roof fire out, but still makes it through the door. With no rolling at all. Disappointing.\medskip
The warehouse map uses Papyrus font. Nice.\medskip
The warehouse is full of robots singing an annoying christmas song.\medskip
The rude man is revealed as Chris Tingle. GBonko inspects his face for orcish features.\medskip
Crappy addresses Chris. He asks if he’s the real Chris. “We’re all Chrises”. “But are you THE chris”. “No Im just Chris.” Crappy stabslashes Chris. GBonko is incredulous at the stlashing. Geric tries to disarm Crappy. A Crappy sword flies from his hands as Geric shoves Crappy away from Chris.\medskip
Geric berates Crappy saying he’s out of control.\medskip
Chris instructs the robots to kill, who start singing a jolly murder song.\medskip
The robots mostly attack GBonko. They miss Ghenri. They attempt to wrap GBonko in wrapping paper. A robot watches Gabby fire pissing. Gabby flails wildly in response, twatting the robot and running away.\medskip
Ghenri stabs a bitch.\medskip
Chris whips at Geric. An amazing verbal sparring occurs between Chris and Geric.\medskip
GBonko reflects on his poor life choices and bitch wife. He retreats behind some nearby crates and starts continues to drink.\medskip
Ghenri continues his stabathon and grabs a chunk of robot wiring.\medskip
Crappy picks up his sword and stabby stabs a robot.\medskip
Geric once again turncoats and tries to sleeper hold Ghenri, but panics at the last minute and bolts from the warehouse.\medskip
Ghenri gets wrapped up good. With a bow. And hammered.\medskip
Gbonko and Gabby also get hammered. Apt for Gbonko.\medskip
Gabby flails repeatedly. It’s pretty effective. Except when it isn’t.\medskip
Chris whips Crappy.\medskip
Gbonko drinks more and has PTSD flashbacks about why he hates orc so much. It’s because of his father I think. His wife slept with a lathe? He pulls out a giant hammer. Too little too late? The robot doesn’t die despite some great alcohol fuelled hits. Everyone listens to sad Carol of the Bells.\medskip
Ghenri bursts out of the wrapping paper and attempts to jump onto the crates. He’s struck twice in the air and goes limp, but just before he lands jolts back to life with a second wind.\medskip
Geric is looking for the police but hasnt found them in the ensuing 6 seconds. He tries instead to clothesline Crapple unsuccessfully, who has also tried to run away it seems. Probably sensible.\medskip
The robots continue their murder spree. One manages to gracefully follow Ghenri onto the boxes, but drops his hammer in the process into the box gaps. Gbonko laughs at the pathetic toy robot hammers.\medskip
Crapple tries to do something but the context is lost in meta discussion. It seems fine.\medskip
Gabby rifles through her pockets for flammable materials finding the pamphlets. She drops some smoldering tinder into some nearby boxes as she darts away from the bots.\medskip
Chris takes on Gbonko, whipping in his drunk face.\medskip
Gbonko thinks Chris thinks he’s better than him and finally kills one of the robots.\medskip
Ghenri jumps away from the bots and looses a fire arrow at Chris, but misses, instead sending some boxes ablaze.\medskip
Crapple cries out to nearby Chrismas revellers for help while courageously sprinting away. They oblige in providing assistance, letting him know where a nearby sawbones lies.\medskip
Geric follows the revellers to the police station.\medskip
The robots huddle in the middle of the factory. Probably conspiring to form a union. Another unsuccessfully wraps Gbonko.\medskip
Gabby continues her full lap around the factory, but clumsily smacks into a box, setting it aflame.\medskip
Chris whips Gbonko, who feels the old familiar sting. He still hurts.\medskip
Gbonko channels the rage into a reckless attack on the robot before him, smashing it to pieces. He drinks its oil, spitting it onto the fire, then vomits.\medskip
Gbonko pleads with Chris to leave this damn burning factory. As he does, a flaming arrow bursts through Chris’ cranium. As he crumples to the floor, Gbonko tearfully holds Chris’ limp body in his arms, offering him help.\medskip
Gabby tells Gbonko, and especially Ghenri, that they could one day be Garys.\medskip
Geric and firefighters arrive as they are leaving. Gabby tries to blame pedophiles, and Geric in particular. The firemen tell Geric that he’s in dodgy ground, but looking at the teenage Gabby, ephibophilia isnt pedophilia, and promptly leave, not wanting to get involved. Everyone is concerned by this response to serious sexual assault allegations in the current climate.\medskip
Gbonko wants to get paid and get (more) drunk. Gabby reassures him that after a hard days Garying they will get drunk.\medskip
Everyones rests and heals up. They head back to Bobacious.\medskip
The group explain what happened at the factory to Derek, Gabby explaining that Geric was exposed as a pedophile. Derek is relieved to hear that at least the factory was burnt down as desired.\medskip
The group reflects on their lost comrade and their own actions, but agree that they must press on FOR GARY. It is also pointed out that ultimately Geric tried to get the authorities involved, and snitches get stitches.\medskip
Derek tell the group to crash the Jennys Ball and make sure it’s terrible, but with no violence.\medskip
Gbonko feels shaken and nervous about the ball, and inquiries as to if he has anything that could help with that. He is handed a bottle of “cough syrup”. Derek tells the group to get dressed up.\medskip
Ghenri knows a poisoneer, and not the fish kind (he’s French. GET IT?).\medskip
The group head to the ball.\medskip
Gapple reminisces about all his favourite apple based holidays, lamenting these newfangled Chris based shenanigans.\medskip
A crooner singing festive hits is on the stage. Chris Martin. It’s populist, but dull.\medskip
There are 3 guards around from the Jennys guild and the thieves guild, known as the three Ho’s.\medskip
Ghenri scopes out the kitchen and asks to compliments the chefs. The waiters lead Ghenri back to the kitchen.\medskip
Gapple creepily talks to the security Jennys, asking if they’re after any mercenary work. They explain that everyone here is a violent killer so they’re not really needed, they’re there more for diplomacy.\medskip
Gabby looks around skeptically, worrying that she could easily be persuaded into being a Jenny being the young, impressionable whore she is.\medskip
Derek Bobacious is there and spots Gabby. Gabby berates Derek for being at the ball at all, warning him of the Jennys pleasure. Derek is up for seductive pleasure, being “immune” to their charm.\medskip
The chef takes Ghenris compliments poorly, refusing to give up his recipe, but Ghenri just wants to talk cooking being from the famous for its cuisine city of Jecede.\medskip
GBonko asks if the most approachable person wants a drink. He talks about shitting on people. “I’ve heard people pay good money for that” “Yeah, fucking Orcs!”. GBonko is very cynical and angry at the fancy ball, stating that it’s nothing but shit and slaves. He’s trying to ruin the party by making people miserable. Unforunately he’s far too charismatic, finding his deep philosophical learnings grossly interesting, inspiring them to forget the woes of society he espouses by drinking, dancing, and revelling. He tries to vomit to make up for his excessive charm, but his iron stomach after years of heavy regret drinking, means he is incapable. He resigns to being the life of the party.\medskip
Gabby continues to look for clues and ins, but she’s starting to become obsessed with the singer, Chris Martin.\medskip
Gapple notices one other guard in red. Big and hench. Hunky. Big white beard. Phwoar. He introduces himself as Chris Mas. He’s there to tell them all about the Chris’ special bulking regimen, saying they can all learn to be swole like him, and how the Chris’ are dedicated to making everyones lives better. Awful.\medskip
Gapple says he’s a Jennys pleasure boy, and says he’s here at Chris Mas’ service. Chris Mas looks him up and down. “You’re not my type. Too small” Gapple is deeply offended.\medskip
Ghenri has engaged the chef in conversation, and tries to poison the food, but the chef clearly sees him mid poison. Ghenri tells him he’s actually a terrible chef, and that he didnt want to hurt his feelings, so was trying to secretly improve the food while also sharing his knowledge to help him improve as a chef. The chef bursts into tears and asks to try the poisoned food. Ghenri convinces him that he is not worthy of this fine cuisine, and he should go home and reconsider his career as a chef.\medskip
Gabby did some stuff I didnt hear while I typed the above.\medskip
GBonko gets out an acoustic guitar and tries to play badly on stage, singing off key and playing annoying scales. It’s very mediocre, which of course is worse than both good and very bad music.\medskip
Gabby sounds fucking wasted, trying to convince Chris Martin they have to get really wasted? She wants to sing a song. GBonko pushes Chris Martin off the stage, and tells GBonko to hit it. GBonko starts to play Classical Gassy Orcs. Gabby sings Wonderwall. GBonko starts playing guitar percussion. It’s really really bad. BOOOOOO\medskip
The poisoned food comes out ready. Appalled by the performance, everyone rushes to the buffet and stuffs their faces.\medskip
Gapplesauce joins in the performance. Everyone starts screaming. The guests have started bleeding out of their eyes. Gapple asks Chris Mas from the stage about the “real Chris”, pressing him for the HQ location. Chris is no chump, and ain’t giving up shit. Especially as everyone is currently bleeding out of their eyes. He storms out, but conveniently drops a letter behind him.\medskip
Derek is very happy about the terrible party. It’s gone midnight and Gabby worries about her parents reaction to the late night. Derek reads the mysterious Chris letter.\medskip
“Tomorrow Chris Mas day will happen. Make sure everyone has a good time so the plan will happen. A. B.”\medskip
Derek turns Scottish with anger. It’s a phrase. He tells everyone to return to the Gary guild tomorrow to finish this.\medskip
The group arrive at the Gary guild. Gabby feels rough. GBonko hasn’t shown up.\medskip
“Today we ruin Chris Mas once and for all!” says Derek. Derek leads the group to an unassuming house. Gabby flails at the door. Gapple snaps his lock pick in the lock. Gabby continues slapping at the door, smashing it open. GBonko stumbles upon the house. “Hey! Itsh, shyou guysh. I think?”\medskip
The group blindly enter the house and begin rooting through the drawers. Gabby happens to move the drawers in the drawers finding a secret switch, opening a secret passageway.\medskip
Gabby hears some clucking from the passage and heads down. The group are attacked by 2 rafters (swarms) of gobbling turkeys. The group fight back obviously, and probably win easily. It’s not a classic fight or anything. The details don’t matter much, but GBonko drinks cough syrup, Gabby runs away a bit, the turkeys have chicken rabies, which Gapple contracts and will probably die in 6-8 weeks, Gabby also gets chicken aids. Ghenri garlic arrows the turkeys, making them tastier. Gapple stabs em up as usual, dicing up the garlicy turkeys. Gabby flails at the rabid pecking turkeys remaining while running further away and holding a door shut to keep the turkeys out, but the turkeys burst the door down against her measly strength. GBonko drinks. Gabby finally murders the last of the turkeys.\medskip
Gabby coughs up turkey aids blood and feathers. GBonko pisses on Bobacious unimpressively. Derek mocks GBonko’s pathetic penis. GBonko passes out, but conveniently wakes back up with a promise of an ending very soon for this ridiculous one shot adventure.\medskip
Bobacious enters the final room. “Goddamit, I knew it was you”. A blonde woman and older man stand before him. “Oh hello father”. It’s Amelia Bobacious! DUNDUNDUN. Josh is impressed with this deep deep reference. The other man says “Oh hello father.” “No, you’re not my son! You’re my son in law!” Harsh.\medskip
There’s some family back and forth about guilds and stuff. Amelia explains her business to Derek. Derek questions how she’s making money off giving away free toys. “Quith” explains that everyone receiving a present or gift today has actually signed an agreement stating they will owe the Chris guild lots of money, they just didn’t read the small print. Dastards. “But people will never pay such a hidden agreement!” shouts Derek incredulously.\medskip
Derek demands Amelia divorce Quith and stop this nonsence. Amelia presses a button opening a secret door revealing MegaMechaSantaClaus. “I believe this Claus will be able to uphold the contract clause”. Everyone groans and bays for blood and/or Santa oil.\medskip
Gapple stabs Quith in the heart, who lays dying. Amelia pleads with Derek to spare Quith. Mechasanta anticlimactically explodes on his own. Ghenri stands in confusion, unsure what to do. The group stand down in deference to Derek.\medskip
Amelia and Derek make up over Quith’s dying body, with Amelia agreeing to give up the guild to spare Quith. At this moment, Ghenri accidentally looses an arrow, which ricochets off several walls before killing Quith instantly. He awkwardly walks backwards out of the room. “Well, I guess that’s the meaning of QuithMas.”\medskip
Roll credits.\medskip
Epilogue: Gabby and Gapple both die of chicken aids. GBonko succumbs to his alcoholism, leaving behind a widow and some children who probably starve to death. Geric becomes a police officer, but is brutally cut down in the field of duty by a mysteriously angry group of children. The case remains unsolved. Ghenri decided to follow his first passion and opened a cookery school, but was brutally murdered by what was assumed to be a jilted former student unhappy at Ghenri’s harsh teaching methods. Scribbled on the walls in Ghenri’s blood at the crime scene were the words “YOU’RE ONTRAYS ARE SHIT”.
