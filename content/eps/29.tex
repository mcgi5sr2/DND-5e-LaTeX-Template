\section{Episode 29: In a While, Crocodile}

\begin{multicols}{2}

\DndDropCapLine{T}here is a large party with muchos bongos. The tribespeople love bongos. As does everyone. It’s like the Ewok party from Episode VI: a little weird and culturally insensitive. We are guideless. Rudderless. Lost in the wilderness. 
Jeremy think he’s welcome in the jungle. Thinks he knows where he is. But jungle is massive. Monkey don’t know shit. 
The tribespeople think it’s grim oop norf, and guide us south. Which is weirder apparently. Weird shit like… Brighton. Jeremy wants to get into Myron’s pocket or something. Myron berates him for not having pockets. He’s also shit poor. Dirty monkey. The party mostly consists of fruit. Even without Pilch. ZING. Try the fish. Ellie interrupts complaining about football not being on TV. Bloody women eh? Exme offers Vu Dong roast squirrel monkey. “Try the brain, it is most delicious.” says Dong. The group takes a bunch of the food, flint, tinder, rope, y’know anything that will be generally useful in the next few DnD sessions. The tribespeople haven’t discovered metal. But they do have rock. Everyone goes to sleep.\medskip

Myron asks where we’re going. Riphard doesn’t trust the savages. Gnomes have two arses. Myron and Kolo think that the tribespeople have been very kind so we should probably trust their primitive knowledge. Exme gives Jeremy a squirrel monkey skull collar that says Jeremy. Kolo thinks he can read the stars through 100\% tree canopy cover. Not to mention the potential differences in celestial patterns on this world. Jeremy knows all about saunas in the jungle and confidently thinks he can take us there. The group looks forward to a nice spa resort relax. He seems to agree with the savages. Riphard is skeptical. The group offers Riphard counselling for his racism. Myron is an arbitrary ranger apparently. The group travel south for a day and a half, surviving off spider monkeys and crabs.\medskip

Jeremy,Kolo, and Myron notice two giant beasties standing in a river up ahead. Gargantuan jungle giants. One is a 100ft giant crab, staring down an 80ft tall, 100ft long Elk, with enormous antlers that peak above the trees. They are rutting. Exme does the classic “are they small or far away” Father Ted joke. Good stuff. Myron wants to give them a wide berth and to not disturb the monstrosities. Respect nature and all that. Very Star Trek. Myron is a witcher. Awesome. Myron knows they are basically gods. Kolo wants one of them to die to harvest is giant organs. The Elk charges the Crab. The Crab grabs the antlers with it’s claws and they start wrestling. Riphard speculates about 80ft Elk dick, and wants to study the creatures for scientology. Myron has seen and eaten enough crabs in his time to know that massive crabs are the same as normal crabs and therefore wholly uninteresting. The group travels on despite Riphard’s protests.\medskip

The south is murkier and softer (obviously). Myron steps on a frog. Jeremy licks it. Myron claims to have deliberately killed it because it’s poisonous. Kolo knows it isn’t because of his drug expertise. Vu and Riphard step in a tar pit. Tarnation. Vu counts his spears, as you do when you step in tar. Myron throws Riphard a rope. There’s a bunch of trees overhead…? Riphard grabs the rope. Exme hears the flapping of wings and the group enter combat. Cue pokemon encounter music. \medskip

As the creatures swoop down, we see that they are… GIANT STURGES! Normal sturges are tiny, but these are cat and/or gnome sized. They’re like… bats or something? With massive noses. 4 of the sturges attack Rip in the tar. One of them latches on to him, sucking his blood. 2 attach to Dong. Riphard worries about the monkey blood that might get spilt. Exme gets one on her, which is the size of her. Kolo hits Exme with an arrow. “It’s too jungly in here”. Vu Dong is thigh deep in tar being attacked by 4 leechbats, 2 attached to him already. He thinks he can use them to get out of the tar or something. Classic Jeremy. He hits himself with his stick. Not everyone can do that! He twats the two suckers on him, does some magic shit, and hits them again. They look really fucked, but dat face when they still suckin. Exme doesn’t blame Kolo for hitting her with an arrow. Goblins are very understanding of collateral damage. Myron attempts to lasso Riphard with his rope. The sturges block the lasso and it lands in the tar. Riphard slashes one of the suckers twice. SHE STILL SUCKIN. Riphard grabs the fuck out of the lasso and is dragged out of the tar. The sturges suck on Rip and Jezza. Ouch. Looking pale. Another sucker sucks on Rip, hard. Some of them attack Myron and Kolo. Myron shrugs the suckers off. Delilah gets sucked, which Riphard doesn’t like. Deli tries to rapier it, but for once she misses.\medskip

Kolo doesn’t shoot Exme again, instead missing stabbing something the size of himself that is attached to him. Flailing randomly. Useless goblins. Vu swings at one of the things attached to him, killing it. He looks temporarily healthier. He swings at one in the air, but it makes him look like a monkey. He also has a couple more swings at another one. How many attacks does this monkey get?! He hits. Exme shoots at the thing on Kolo, and kills it. It being the thing. Not Kolo. Riphard tuts to himself. Myron shotguns a sturge off Riphard. That seems safe. Unbelievably it works. Riphard slices at the one remaining on him and hits it hard, but drops his off-hand scimitar into the tar! Riphard gets another one attached! He looks incredibly pale. Deathly almost. Delilah also looks in bad shape. There could be some tough choices in the near future…\medskip

The group doesn’t do much as they near death. Myron shrugs it off. Vu does kill one. Exme kills the one on Delilah, rescuing her from almost certain death! Not Riphard though, fuck that guy. Myron bayonets himself for MASSIVE DAMAGE. But he shrugs it off. He bayonets it again. Rip misses the things and burns with an intense internal inferno. Delilah kills one of the ones of Rip and does some cool shit, healing herself and kills the other one of Rip. EXCEPT NONE OF THIS HAPPENED BECAUSE MIKE FORGOT TO DO THE STURGE ATTACK FIRST AND I REMINDED HIM. #THATGUY. Rip’s firebrand doesn’t matter, Riphard falls unconscious anyway at the relentless sucking, because SHESTILLSUKIN. But it’s not completely in vain as Vu Dong feels slightly better than he would’ve. Rips Scimitar sinks into the tarry oblivion, and Rip starts to sink himself. Everyone kills the remaining things, with some classic Stephen metabants.\medskip

Exme is jealous of Delilah’s hat, but doesn’t resent her for it. She checks herself, prior to wrecking herself, and proceeds to rescue Riphard. Riphard wakes up with a jolt “DID ANYONE TOUCH THE MONKEY BLOOD?!”. Jeremy seems to be trying to insert something into Riphards groin… Riphard bats him away. The group longrest and everyone berates Riphard for not firebranding at the start of the battle. Hindsight is 20/20 fuckers. Exme calms the group with hat based compliments and craves coke. There is no coke in the jungle, but Kolo somehow cobbles together some jungle Koca-Kolo, branded Um-Bolo. It’s understood that they drink it in the Kolo. Exme mainlines one immediately and suddenly gets the worst dry mouth, feeling super thirsty. She starts downing papaya-based alcohol. Kolo starts succumbing to the jungle heat and exertion, looking exhausted. He drinks some papaya-juice, and does some delightful goblin hijinks. There some short people bantz. 4’2”. Hilarious. Riphard scoffs at these shorties.\medskip

Jeremy catches some Beatles. The group want to trebuchet Jeremy. There’s some discussion about where to go. Riphard laughs to himself. There’s a wall apparently. Exme has OCD. Myron: “EAST SIDE IS DA BEST” Riphard: “WEST WEST WEST”. Myron reluctantly agrees, and Riphard looks smug and walks off East. Idiot. Another day and a half heading East, running out of supplies. Myron smells water nearby. A huge argument breaks out about the nature of smelling water. Nonetheless, the group stumble miraculously on an oasis. That was thanks to Myron. Definitely. Maybe. Kolo gets bitten by something out of the blue, grappled in the water. He gets pretty fucked up. “Crikey!” - Riphard.  “No, crocky” - someone else. This croc is fucking massive, christ. Riphard still feels disappointed at the missed opportunity to study the Elk and Crab. Vu Dong says he couldn’t smell the croc because of all the water. Kolo finds himself in the giant crocs mouth. He hunters marks it from the inside. He then poison bows it, giving it a bad tooth ache. Myron does some sick shit, dancing along the croc and jumps into the croc bayonet first. The bayonet ricochets off the crocs scaly hide. As he does this he also shoots it. This does hurt it. The croc bites Kolo, who is already in its mouth. “That cock makes me so happy” - Stephen H, 19/09/2017. Kolo gets swallowed. Richard thatguys a bit about how firebrand ain’t saving Kolo this time. He’s definitely dying. Rip firebrands, makes a great joke about non-religiously blessing bullets, and misses badly. Exme gets out of the water. Delilah misses again, surges, and nails the croc on the second asking, forcing the croc to be shit the next time. Vu Dong jumps on the croc and bashes it with his monkey stick a few times. Stunning. Which I think stuns it or something. It is stunned. He continues wailing on it.\medskip

Kolo starts dissolving. Myron pulls out a small metal canister, throwing it down the crocs throat. Sadly it isn’t crocodile stomach acid neutralizing spray, just a smoke bomb, giving the croc a cool dry-ice effect pouring from its mouth. He also bayonets it. The croc ain’t bothered about the smoke in its mouth. Rip readies a smiting shot. “Seeya later Aligator”, and shoots it dead, vomiting up Kolo. Myron starts musing on the differences between crocs and gators. Exme rushes to revive Kolo. Riphard looks “happy” at Kolo’s survival. The group all congratulate Riphard on his heroism. He feels genuine warmth at the first sign of actual friendship in his miserable existence. He glances over to his fiance. The croc is skinned and will make a fine suit of armor. The group debate the finer points of owl poop. \medskip

The group rest and recover. Kolo now has acid burns. Exme has made 2 masterwork studded leather armors, given to Kolo is remembrance of being partly dissolved, and Rip for slaying the mighty beast. Exme is still a coke fiend though. Sad. Exme eats random leaves in hopes of chasing that sweet, sweet high. Myron notices a few ancient, long since unused, trails. They show signs of ancient footfall. Myron ponders the implications of this before rushing into something. He takes a knee, looking closely at the track, feeling the very vibe of the surroundings. He detects no monstrosities within the area, instead feeling a calming presence. The trail winds up through the side of hilly areas, working its way upwards to a clearing with a dilapidated cottage. Crumbling walls, broken stone work, holes in the roof. It looks a little out of place in its little enclave in the jungle. Exme wants to build more trebuchets. The gang wants the trebuchet on Trevor the pacifist triceratops, which the group have been travelling on. Jeremy has a look from the roof of the cottage, getting a good view of the surrounding areas, even seeing snow in the far distance, and the ridge to the north the group skirted. The roof gives way, but Jeremy falls with style, hanging from the decaying rafters. Kolo investigates the inside of the cottage. There’s a rusty kettle. Kolo looks past the tempting kettle and roots around in the rubble and centuries of crap on the floor, quickly finding markings on the ground, but it appears incomplete. The group spend a few hours shifting rubble, fully uncovering the apparent chalk markings, although the longevity of the marking suggest otherwise. The religious Rip and Myron don’t know shit about this. But Kolo immediately knows it’s a teleportation circle. He explains this in Goblinerish. Myron struggles to believe in the seemingly impossible. Kolo mimics the giant crab from earlier.\medskip

Exme measures the circle in at 80,000,000 Dumbledores (“That’s 80,000 Hogwarts!”). The detect-o-matic suggests we need to stand in bits within the circle to complete it. “According to this, we need to place the monkey in a trebuchet. I keed. I KEED! We just need chalk to draw some chalk dicks, some chicken or animal blood, not dangerous monkey blood, tie your hair back, hang on to your hats and glasses''. “I really don’t know if this is the best course of action. I’ve come to accept a lot of things that I’ve come to accept in my time with you guys. But standing in a weird circle with you guys that might potentially delete me forever is too much. I just want to ask someones opinion who I actually trust!” - Myron. “I understand your dread, but it’ll just take us wherever there’s another circle.” - Kolo. “There might be a dragon on the otherside or something!” - Rip. “What’s a drag on?” - Everyone else. “How bout, rather than send everyone, we just send one person, worst case scenario, one down.” - Myron. “What if it’s just one way?” - Rip. “One monkey down?” - Rip. “Why are we even here?” - Rip. “Some monkey bullshit” - Jeremy. There some attempt to trick various people into teleporting themselves. Kolo volunteers to teleport first. Jeremy farts badly. The group stand in position except Myron, who isn’t coming. Exme convinces Myron into the circle, and Kolo says the magic word “Superted”.\medskip

\textbf{Epilogue}

As Riphard soars through the metaphysical unknown, he ponders to his ethereal self on the meaning of existence, the futility of this battle with the living to improve the lives of the dead. He thinks of Delilah, and whether her beautiful flesh will reassemble as beautifully as he remembered. Will he even remember after this? Is this what it’s like to die? Is this what it’s like being born? A soothing music washes over him and he smiles as a light begins to come into focus.\medskip
