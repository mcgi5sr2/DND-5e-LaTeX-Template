\section{Episode 33: I Aint Afraid of No... Semi-Sentient Discorporeal Energy Sources}

\medskip

\DndDropCapLine{G}host go bye bye, we’re stood around like nubbins. Riphard kicks in the door to the south. There is a corridor with rooms. Rip touches a metal door. It’s cold.. Door to east. Wait, no, it’s west. Rip squeaks a door open. Vu decapitates some skellys in the room. Exme also wanders off to her likely doom. She finds the only toilet in all of fantasy land. It’s a pit. Vu is entranced. Exme finds a study/practical space - it’s a wreck. Rip is racist. There’s another Lab, with undamaged bits and pieces. "Vile Vials of Bile" - Kolo tastes them. They burn him. Lab 3. There’s a button. Kolo presses it. One-way mirror. Mirror one way, window the other. Kolo and Exme can gain advantage making something new. Also, mirror shard for exme. Rip kicks the spooky room. Vu scares him with monkey skull. There is poop.\medskip

Vu screams into more rooms. Rip thinks the goblins are eating the poop. Rip finds all sorts of dust, mortar and pestles, and rocks and rock powder. And things he loves. Weird dwarf. We split the party. Goblins one way, Rip the other. Vu does not like. Gretta Basalt was an awesome rock-dust person. Like, obsessed, and exclusive to all other useful reagents. Hamprered her ability a bit. Rip is hard. More advanced chambers ahead. Ghost attacks Kolo, Vu comes to the rescue. Beats the shit out of the big stormy evil thing. It floats away. Kolo values his penis.\medskip

Vu and Exme get stuck in Quicksand, except it’s not there as Kolo points out. We split up to look for clues. Exme gets attacked, Jinkies. Kolo runs to her aid. Kolo gets shot because Exme is posessed. Poor Nipple. Ghost GTFO’s after we lay some smack down, but is still alive. We’re trying to work out if we can actually do anything to it. It’s futile, we’ll just keep letting it hit and run us. Stanri is guinea pig, going through a door.\medskip

We find 3 glass tubes, one is smashed, the others are still filled with smokey ghost-type-matter. Vu suggests smashing one to fight the existing ghost for us. Exme intelligently realises they’re sentient batteries, powering the tower. Vu is a monkey, so useless. We manage to build a ghost trap out of Rips shit, his found rocks, and some of the acid from earlier. Kolo is bait, but he gets fucked stupidly by dropping the stone of Un. Vu catches the ghost with the trap. Exme modulates the frequency in order to keep the ghost caught faster. Vu runs around trying to explore the floor in this half hour span. He comes across a room with two metal rods, and pokes them cautiously. Kolo touches them both and is revitalised by electric energy. Myron is convinced a ghost hole is the way forward. We run crazy-fast. Kolo jumps into a library and reads it really fast. Vu tells everyone there’s only half an hour of half and hour left. We sprint through. CAAANT DAAAN\medskip

Empty rooms, guard houses, dead bodies. Water. CAAAAANT DAAAAAN. Wine. COUNTDOOOOOWN! One guy in a forcefield, super old, nothing interesting. CANT DAA... Next room. Count down? There’s only about half an hour left. Everyone else finds the old near-dead-dude that Vu ran past. Special voice on the dying old git, he tells people he’s not going to do anything to hurt them. Vu continues exploring. Everyone else wakes up (dun dun dun) Rhu Brex.\medskip

He’s old as fuck, and dying. Stasis field to try and live forever. Didn’t work, as we woke him up. Makes the count down… go up to 5 years. Rhu Brex gets us the Die, and then gives us flying machine of some description, that only exme could use really. Delilah has work to do. We get teleported away. The ship falls. Delilah is awesome, saves us from crashing. We’ve got a ship! WE’RE ON A SHIP. Also Delilah is pregnant.\medskip
