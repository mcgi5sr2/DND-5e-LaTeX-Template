\subsection{Episode 10: A Pretzel of Pointless Adventures}
\DndDropCapLine{O}n the return journey from the emoticon tower...\medskip
Kolo tries to convince Riphard that returning Otarios body to Nanduan is a good idea\medskip
Riphard could get paid to evangelise in a new country, by the very church we can raise an a robot army from nanduan against.\medskip
Riphard is having none of it, not believing that Otario is even from Nanduan. Kolo convinces him that he should check out the churches archives and their archivists for more info on Nanduan and the robots.\medskip
On their travel back to RiversFall kolo and Riphard come across a dirty group of 30 urchins playing harmonica. They are pleased to see a Pastor. They are miserable.\medskip
There mines are not for working anymore, the excavator blew a hole into a new catacomb. They are scared of a noisey cave. Imbeciles.\medskip
After some discussions the team head for the mine to solve the noise pollution issue. Thanks to Riphard, the team agree a 10\% stake in the mine, in return for sorting some things out. Thank the Gods that the preacher is in charge of negotiations, as he makes up a contract. Exmeh discovers that it's an iron mine. Fishy has to get involved in the contract, Kolo would probably have been better for this. Luckily? The Old dude Quinzel signs on the dotted line.\medskip
Riphard turns to enter the mine, only to see nothing but a mecha-bear stanri looking at him.\medskip
Kolo mounts Pilch, and with their powers combined, and a climbing pick they descend into the darkness. As Exmeh and Ripahrd nail some 3 point landings behind them. Something other than humans is down here with us.\medskip
Pilch heads off down a dead end until he is re-directed. They are sneaky little shits that keep stabbing us from the darkness. Its master splinters love children! They have GOAT friends!!! Somehow the Goat gets the drop on the adventurers, luckily Pilch saddles up and Ripahrd blows the rats brains against the wall.\medskip
Post Goat Exmeh takes the lead with her robo “friend”, only for Riphard to get sprung by the wolf pack. Things are 100\% scary in these tunnels, and it’s going badly. RIPhard is getting ravaged by the wolfs. RIPhard is knocked out and is fed some cocaine by Fishy to to fix him up. A tactical retreat is made, while new strats and tats are tried.\medskip
The megaziod is created, Quoth on Kolo on Pilch. Everything is checked out, labelled, set down in the collated diaries, compiled into a digest, before finally being added to the compendium. RIPhard covers our asses.\medskip
We find a room full of dead miners, and a ring of deadly visage! +10 make kolo look dead. Lots of dead ends are identified.\medskip
Kolo suggests a great location to set a trap, Fishy disagrees just before the party is ambushed again. Fishies force field holds true as the Gabrin twins mow down the rats and wolfs. Riphard refuses to lay hands on Pilch, so throws him a healing word instead.\medskip
New marching orders in the direction decided by Riphard. Shitting dwarf illusion first, bird second, kolo pilch next, riphard, exmeh next.\medskip
Kolo gets lowered into a pit of spikes, as an echo of Riphards fart finally comes around. A Pretzel of Pointless Avenues. Before Riphards days living in a hole bears some fruit, as he smashes Pilch straight through a wall. Into a room co-habited by Goat Men and a rat man that makes a swift exit. Gabrins dispatch on Goat, before Pilch slices and dices the last one, collecting accolades and ears.\medskip
Kolo finds a man of the church in the piles of bodies. He has 2 packs of 4 sticks of dynamite, and Riphard collects a load of church documents from the mine expert.\medskip
While distracted looting corpses the valiant team are almost surprised by Liono and WolfBoys. Riphard gets his back against the wall, as he puts 2 n 2 together looking at the animals in tight lion cloths. Rats take on Exmeh, while the goats seem to have a hard on for Fishy! Gabrins are deathly afraid of lions, this could go badly.\medskip
Fishy casts a cloud of darkness on the kitana and chucks it behind the goats, plunging everyone into the darkness. Gabrins hide together in the corner of the darkness popping shots into the unknown. Riphard fucks up the lion from outside, before the burning angry lion comes running straight out of the dark cloud into his face. Turns out old GoldenHide Liono is a tough SoB! Fishy dives out of the shadows and uses some kind crazy shadow sword shit to really fuck up liono. Before Exmeh having run pure electriciy through her system blows the liono to pieces.\medskip
However taking out the last rat needs a thunder whip explosion from Riphard creating a Mural of Rat on the Walls.\medskip
The party finds a huge hole down into the underdark, which they promptly blow up.\medskip
Riphard closes the agreement between the mine owner and Northern Rock for 10\% of the mines outgoings.
