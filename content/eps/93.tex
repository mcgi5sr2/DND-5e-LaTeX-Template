\subsection{Episode 9.3: Kolo's Tale (Part 3): Kiss Myasis}
\DndDropCapLine{A}s the group arrive in Thundertree, Stanri is privately devastated to discover the once shining symbol of goblin emancipation in both literal and metaphorical ruins. To distract himself from the pain he attempts to lead a 3 gabrin game of "what's that bush?" which Tani and Kriigo are very eager to join in with. Pineapple appears to be the group consensus and they all enjoy drinking the white, sticky fluid from the pineapple bushes roots. Just like gramma's bush. A cursory inspection of a nearby house shows ruined furniture and shattered lives (probably).\medskip

BUT WHAT'S THIS?! Stanri's keen ears and eyes and nose holes have picked up a clue, a strange rustling in the undergrowth. He tries to convey this in a non-verbal message to Tani, however there is a slight misunderstanding and the weasel is killed by Tani's bow. Devy is not able to see the funny side, and in the resulting confusion Stanri slips away into the bushes to investigate the source of the rustling. This proves to be the largest error on Stranri's part since Tani and Kriigo take it upon themselves to engage in a series of profane and deeply psychologically disturbing, aggressive sexual activities. These start off small with Stanri returning to find that Kriigo has started to rage hump Tani after finding 3 dead gabrin bodies in a house, and is currently bent over with a poisoned arrow inserted into his anus. Stanri does not approve, but the younger gabrins tell him that he just doesn't get it. Stanri wonders when he did in fact last understand "it".\medskip

Stanri revivifies a dead goblin (which he curiously finds posed with the other goblins in the shape of a throne?) and learns that humans had slaughtered the adults in the town. The dead goblin teaches Stanri that emancipation means letting people be as they want to be. If they are not harming anyone else then let them be and do whatever they see fit. Stanri understands now that his prejudice against the two younger goblins'ses sexy acts was wrong and that a goblin shouldn't judge other goblins. Stanri then goes off to follow child goblin sized foot prints, which is good because his tolerance would have really been put to the test if he had seen what was going to happen next.\medskip

Sexual activities not limited to but including the following: - Tani lubing up her full arm with her own goblin spit - Kriigo removing the head from the now unanimated reanimated corpse - The use of the head as a ... spacer?.... prophylactic .... decoration? .... basically Kriigo shoved the decapitated head onto his dick so that his dick went like all the way through it (i guess neck hole through mouth?) and then fucked Tani with the other end. They are basically step siblings but it was agreed this was not incest, but just necrophilia.\medskip

\subsubsection{Classy}
Stanri is following the tracks. Kriigo and tani are suffering from odd symptoms including fever and hallucination, and learning that it may not be the best idea to fuck dead people. Stanri is able to help Kriigo and save his goblin penis in time, but he is not able to find Tani. Fuck knows where Devi is....\medskip

Tani is in a fucking state. Half fever dream, half french experimental cinema, she wanders the vibrant and multicoloured, pulsing town seeing images of pineapple trees and dying ex-lovers. She loves it. She passes out.\medskip

Stanri and Kriigo find a group of goblin children who appear to be happy and fed despite not having any goblin parents, as stanri believes every goblin family should have. The children saw the weasel being killed. Stanri has an awkward moment where he remembers that it actually would have been really trivial to bring it back to life.....\medskip

\subsubsection{Awks}
The children are being looked after by a human woman who lives in a spooky house in town. When this human is referred to as their "master", Stanri feels a flash of racial pride and a deeper burning of anger. To hear the children of the first emancipated town describe a human as master. How could this BE?!?!!? The children lead Stanri and Son to the home where they meet an odd human woman. Tani is on a table passed out and the two goblins try to reach her, pretending that Stanri is old and hard of hearing and impotent so as to no pose a threat. However the lady is able to see through this and paralyses Stanri, also commanding Kriigo to xxx? Tani is speaking odd words like "toyota" and "holidays in ibiza from 5 9 9". Grumpi fears for her life. A fight commences but it is not long before the goblins are victorious, foam oozing out from Kriigos erect and raging penis and mouth.\medskip

As Grumpi and Tani search the house for clues, Kriigo goes to gather the children and convince them to listen to grumpi. The two find a message that shows that the church of Hemitate has tried to reclaim the town since it used to be their trading point many generations ago. The horror of this genocide. When will the humans learn? Will a single good human even ever be born? Most likely not at all. Fucking humos. The children arrive and Grumpi tries to convince them of something. He is not quite sure what that is, but he tried to make sure that his message is "hip and happening" and that he lets them know how "rad" he is and how "tubular" it is to be emancipated. The children leave without showing any signs of wanting to spare his feelings. Grumpi has never felt more alone. He misses his wife.\medskip

What next for the adventurers eh? Given that the goblin god has stopped speaking and that the church of hemitate has come this far, they may have reached the holy goblin temple. The goblins must cross the scary and wide desert in order to get to the temple and literally and figuratively save the world.
