\subsection{Episode 20: Bizznizz for Banks \& Emancipation for the Few not the Many}
\DndDropCapLine{P}ilch keeps researching some shit, to be honest I am a little surprised he can read. Old smelly Archi can’t help either because he can’t see. The state of the HQ makes a lot more sense now. Exmerahs mask for him is certainly a relief on the eyes, but while watching it repeatedly almost slice Fishys nose off, I does something opening a tunnel in the bookshelf. This reminds me that I probably should have told FishFingers that I was awake and watching him. What he doesn’t know won’t hurt him. Still if I only knew how he opened this bloody door! I wait for ages for him to return, but he is taking his sweet time. Maybe it leads outside like the one in the basement? No I checked for that already no other exits… Maybe he is going for some man time… I’ll leave him to it\medskip
Morning finally comes, and Riphard strikes quite the dashing character in all his livery. We head off the guild of coin, and wow do they have the cash here. We are introduced to Rowlett Marnett the head of the Guilds of Coin, Wellington Hunter-Smyth head of the Guild of Mints, Montague Heartwell Head of the Guild of Traders they talk even funnier than their boss. Riphard wastes no time and gets into this pitch.\medskip
Jaego is not Gary, except for today, and for anyone who hasn’t past the Gary test.\medskip
Mr SoftRock starts the presentation. “Safe Storage for a Dangerous World”, clearly he is misguided about who does what Robbing wise, as we were all recently robbed by people not Gabrins!\medskip
The stored capital is invested, to speculate and accumulate. The team is definitely not us, but I do think we should not be talked down to like this. Is the Gary team member going be in some kind of synergy with the bank. This is all very confusing.\medskip
Mr Bobacious is remembered for his strong ongoing work in RiversFall. Although we haven’t heard from him since we left RiversFall. Rowlett Marnett is very impressed that Derek is on board. Even if the reasoning involves a time paradox. What are all these dates? But luckily we have an appendix slide that answers all our questions.\medskip
So long as the guild of coin members are never asked who we are, who is involved and where they have been, this presentation is flawless.\medskip
The accumulation of stuff is impressing these small minded individuals. The final bamboozle of the investment triangle blows their minds.\medskip
“I don’t know what he said, but I like the way he said it” pure gold from not Pilcheur Garmont.\medskip
Riphard starts to call Rowlett, Rolo but he doesn’t seem to mind. In fact he is impressed, and loves the propensity for growth. He does know a lot about Lemons though, finally someone who understands. He goes for a hard bamboozle, but if anyone knows business its Rowlett, who forces some hard answers. Thankfully he doesn’t mention the huge debt we clocked up last week buying materials for our labs. Roughly 6000gp but its probably best it stays that way. Things are getting confused, until Pilcheur decides that the company is a service, so therefore falls into the realm of the Guild of Coin.\medskip
Exmeh raises some good issues surrounding people greed and the potential of a banking collapse ruining the economy. His second presentation is alarming to say the least! The bank is 74\% mortgages. Who is paying these mortgages!!\medskip
Rowlett invests anyway, which is re-assuring as we have no way of paying that money back that we borrowed, maybe ever!\medskip
The other Guild masters are very impressed as well, everyone starts smoking cigars. If only I was better at deceiving I think I could do really well at this business type.\medskip
Everyone toasts the new Guild of Banking, Huzzah!\medskip
Few days pass, turns out you really don’t need to sleep at all. I set to work making some potions….\medskip
Fishy gets a note from the Mercenaries Guild ….blah blah blah raiding group from the Varg…….. Must be sure to tell Exmerah…. Could it be for us? Best have a chat later with her.\medskip
Jerry is a equalist, 100\% no a speciest. Something horrific took place “the massacre” of the La Rudo family. Means that all contracts for mercenaries now require the contact holder to be alive to be valid. Seems quite a good move.\medskip
Fishy forges the contract, despite the original being held by the mercenary guild. He claims that it effectively means that the contract holding family can die after having waved their rights.\medskip
I have to go shopping, despite having valuable things and potentially explosive things going on upstairs. I set off some 1d6+3 Koka Kolo mixes, they go don’t seem to come out the way I made them last time, but then what does these days. I seem to have misplaced a lot of the fruit I bought for Pilch.\medskip
Gary comes back and stinks of root beer, claiming that he is now the sheriff fist fighting, still not killed anyone.\medskip
Now i think about it I don’t recall any of us signing up to be mercenaries! Well if they are going to pay us to do this, then why not!\medskip
Gary nonchalantly disgorges 4 pints of root beer. The game is on! Pilch catches his hair on the face mask. It’s still an improvement.\medskip
I get the wagon ready with Exmerah, packing in the supplies bought with our own coin. This adventuring is more costly than I had imagined, or certainly is now it isn’t just the two of us.\medskip
We journey North West onto the greater planes. The farming lands, this must be how Hopes Rest is fed, some these land owners may be wealthy indeed. The nights are hard, and maintaining concentration is next to impossible in these monotomous lands. So its not quite a surprise when we get set upon by a 5 man raiding party. 3 Goblins on wargs, and two humans on riding horses, come thundering down on us.\medskip
Pilch kindly asks permission to engage the Gabrins, of course it is granted and his gentlemanly behaviour noted. Although he does then run away…. I get a sense of deja vu. But then find the weak point the guys horse, and kneecap it to buggery. All this dissection is really paying off.\medskip
Emerah demands Parle from the Gabrins. The Gabrins tell her to shut up “southern Scum”. Poor old Exmeh is reminded of home, and pulls the shot. She has too much heart my sister, but only in the fire can we be tempered. She will learn….\medskip
These bloody Gabrins been using toad poison! I will kill them and their toads, so that Mervyn would be pleased. Riphard shoots them, and something magic is in the air because he actually hits, and smotes that damned Gabrin. I shout for Quoth..\medskip
Gary wrestles stupid human off his remaining horse, while a crying Exmerah blows one of the Gabrins into pieces. Gary quickly becomes the center of attention, with Riphard taken on the last GabrinWarg combo, man’O’Gabrin. He whips and nei nei’s the warg.\medskip
Bloody human shoots me again. Your likelihood of survival of this encounter is now zero.\medskip
Gary gets hot into the mix with his 4 attackers. Laying the smack down hard, with a turbo charged gary club. She takes a knee in front of Gary before calling him a weakling!!! She is gonna get smited to shit.\medskip
Pilch returns to the field of battle, sending quoth my way. Human gets shot. Exmerah seems past the tears, she always did move through men fast, as she kills another Gabrin.\medskip
Gary is mixing it heavy, despite Exmerahs assistance he is still fighting four people at once. What a big stone badass he is turning out to be. Finally he plants first his club, and then his magic branch a huge wave of power emanates from him, and petals washe over the humans sending them to sleep. Easy prey, I shoot that evil human to death, the arrow bursting through his chest.\medskip
Riphard thunder whips the warg backwards sitting his ass down. As he backs off he pulls out his pistols, blowing the stupid wargs heads to pieces all over me. 100\% owe this guy my life now. What a badass. I spend the time dissecting the warg from the inside out, very interesting.\medskip
Gary creates a slavers line of two humans and a single Gabrin. He is bringing them back to life. The Gabrins who didn’t come back to life, he punches through his dead face. That is some freaking extreme way to ensure someone is dead. Maybe this rock isn’t such a tree hugging hippy. The captives are all tied back to back, as Gary gives them a good stern talking too. Unknowingly he condemns them all to death, by getting them to march off all tied together. They waddle off to their certain doom.\medskip
“I’m as fucking south as a horse is east” we interrogate the Gabrins, and find out who they serve. Its some pretty bad bloody news if they are from who they say they are.\medskip
Vathena is a highly feared savage elf, one of the Warlords of the North. One his Valkars generals, known for her viciousness, and tiger mount that feared throughout.\medskip
Another bloody elf.\medskip
Gabrins makes the sense of spitting in my sisters face, death is the only reward for this. The Gabrins are not well disposed to us, and are being total douche bags.\medskip
The interrogation continues, Riphard tries to sell the banking to him.\medskip
This is some real scary shit, I really don’t want to go. Pilch has a plan, something we have not done maybe ever before. I saw her feed Gabrins to that giant tiger of hers.\medskip
We move onwards to the Nan-Tucket farm, and our certain doom.\medskip
After staying the night in an abandoned house, which is under constant watch from the enemy, we emerge tired, and facing a bear like entity. It seems death isn’t our destination today after all.
