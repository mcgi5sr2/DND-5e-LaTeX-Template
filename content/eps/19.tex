\subsection{Episode 19: Shopping Land Business Channel - Part 2}
\DndDropCapLine{K}olo has arrived at the Apothecary Guild, all excited to do his big entrance exam. A mildly unpleasant elf woman talks to him at the door and calls him dirty and smelly, but then invites him in to join her guild.\medskip
Kolo goes down the corridor to visit Dr Mittens who administers the entrance tests, which it turns out are more done on applicants than they are by applicants.\medskip
Kolo is strapped to a table while Dr Mittens force feeds him his special new medicine, which cures Kolo of his Jason-Derulo-Cat-Attack-Deficiency. He’s all whigging out all over the place and falling off shit and loving it.\medskip
Kolo apparently does well, and, after a few business days he’ll be a member.\medskip
On the way out, Kolo asks for Dr Mittens’ home address, in a not-at-all worrying manner.\medskip
Meanwhile, Rocky is going to the Guild of Coin place, to invent banking.\medskip
The building is made of gold. What a way to devalue their own product.\medskip
The doors are made of bg trees. Real big trees. Probably expensive trees.\medskip
Rocky grasps the brass knocker in his fist and raps it.\medskip
He goes inside and talks to a gnome, who he warns that he is proposing to abut him.\medskip
He explains the concept of banking, in a pretty succinct way.\medskip
The gnome tells him that he should set up a new guild, because banking doesn’t exist. If he wants to do that, he needs the following:\medskip
6 radical members 1 audacious business plan, presented to a gnarly committee A shit-tonne of money (which is the only word in this guy’s language ( I think it works like the Smurfs’ language))\medskip
The guild is going to need all the normal corporate positions to be filled:\medskip
HIO: Head Interface Officer\medskip
GBUI: Global Business Unification Investigator\medskip
JOLK: Job Organiser, Lower Klass\medskip
QRTTO: Quota, Rosta, Training and Torture Officer\medskip
UI: Untrustworthy Individual\medskip
GUI: Grossly Untrustworthy Individual\medskip
Rocky says he’s going to do that, probably.\medskip
Pilch writes a note offering the party up as mercenaries within the city for some non-descript work.\medskip
Everyone gets back to the Fire House at the same time and Exme harrasses Archibald for not taking down all the walls on the third floor like she asked. Baldy’s a bitch about it.\medskip
There’s arguments.\medskip
Bedrooms are important, but so is a lab, so who wins?\medskip
Gary wins. He punches all the walls until they fall down.\medskip
Baldy says that the meeting about the decision about the fate of the building is tomorrow, and everyone can go if they feel like it.\medskip
They decide they might as well, and they’re all tired from all these jobs they have now, so everyone decides to go to bed. Fishy is seen slinking off to bed with a taxidermied camel’s head. Someone probably wins a bet.\medskip
In the morning, everyone decides what jobs they want in the bank guild.\medskip
HIO: Head Interface Officer - Riphard “The Boss.”\medskip
GBUI: Global Business Unification Investigator - Gary “People should all be doing their jobs more or less the same.”\medskip
JOLK: Job Organiser, Lower Klass - Delilah *“What should people even be doing? How? Why?”\medskip
QRTTO: Quota, Rosta, Training and Torture Officer - Pilch “Keeping lists, making sure people on the lists do what they should. Otherwise, torture.”\medskip
UI: Untrustworthy Individual - Exme “People who try to get in the bank, get hit by traps!”\medskip
GUI: Grossly Untrustworthy Individual - Kolo “People who will not pay the bank, get broken limbs!”\medskip
Later, on their way home, fine operatives of the noble Thieves Guild come and ply their trade on the upstanding business gabrins in one alleyway and Gary and Fishy in another.\medskip
Exme is very happy to comply, Kolo asks if he can join.\medskip
Apparently it’s not the time or place for applications, but they all have a nice chat anyway. Everyone’s swapping cards and networking. Kevin offers to relay their interest to the guild, and asks them if they want to know how high all the windows in the area are.\medskip
Kolo tries to get him hooked on the horse-cocaine. He appreciates it, but is unable to accept anything but money.\medskip
The gabrins hand over the money and get their receipt. They promise to leave Kevin a good review.\medskip
In the other alleyway, Gary and Brucey - an enterprising fellow who is a policemen in the day and a thief at night - have a nice chat.\medskip
Gary apologises for not having any pockets, Fishy just doesn’t have money, so they both assume the position and get kicked for a bit.\medskip
Fishy is a dick and tries to be spikey, nearly killing everyone who’s kicking him. Gary kicks him, for not playing by the rules. The heavily wounded thieves run off.\medskip
As soon as they get back to HQ, it’s time to leave for the meeting.\medskip
They go to the nice meeting hall on the banks of the Salty Eldon. The river so polluted they have affectionate nicknames for the diseases it gives you (e.g. Elly Belly).\medskip
Inside the meeting room, a cat is the judge. She is called Mickey Longpaw. She is suave, and is wearing a bitchin’ fur coat made of her ex-husband.\medskip
Gary gets so bored that he makes everyone fall asleep, which they’d probably do anyway.\medskip
The figures for the thieves guild are up 7\%. It’s pretty wholesome.\medskip
The assassins guild have killed a lot of really cool people recently. Everyone’s pretty impressed.\medskip
The cleaners and plumbers are a lot more boring.\medskip
People start talking about the fire house.\medskip
Pilchy Loozaroo says “It should be about the book-burners, but definitely not because I’m one.”\medskip
Jago stands up and pleads the case to use the house as a Gary-Guild House. People are interested.\medskip
Some bellend thinks that we should give it to the Church. No one loves that idea.\medskip
Lazaroo does a good speech about The Church being bad and the Gary-Guild being good.\medskip
Big Reveal, Papa Gary Lazariz.\medskip
Jago makes a much better speech about The Church being bad and the Gary-Guild being good.\medskip
People go ape shit. There’s cheering. There’s chanting. Then they vote.\medskip
Everyone votes for Gary.\medskip
Gary. Gary. Gary. GARRRYYYYY!!!!!!!\medskip
The Gary-Guild have a clubhouse, even if they don’t technically exist.\medskip
Everyone’s Gary now.\medskip
Gary draws the new logo for the guild. It’s a universal hit.\medskip
They organise a meeting at the clubhouse so that the heads of all the Guild Families can get in on the ground floor of the city’s newest hit guild.\medskip
Gary feels as if he is in the den of a dragon as he desperately makes his case for the financial viability of the Gary-Guild\medskip
He unveils the beautiful finalised version of the logo.\medskip
They explain that the guild won’t actually make any money, which the money guild guy seems to be upset about.\medskip
He’s oot.\medskip
The families try to impress the party with the services they could offer the Garies.\medskip
Eventually, they manage to convince The Guilds of Services, Might and Life to enter into a joint venture.\medskip
The Guild of Garys is go. BRAPPP\medskip
The other families get solty.\medskip
A few days later, while the paperwork is in process, some small folk comes to meet Esme to reply to the flier that Pilch accidentally delivered.\medskip
There’s a wide range of skill levels. One guy empties bins, one guy has built the actual international space station.\medskip
There’s a dwarf, who Exme wants to throw out instantly, but annoyingly he’s really good.\medskip
Kolo and Esme assess their potential assistants, and they go through to another round making weapons out of meat.\medskip
Then she realises how little they’re going to have to pay their assistants and hires them all, because fuck peasants, they’re hardly people.\medskip
EXME LAB Hiring Initiative 3 assistants - 1 gp per week each 1 female goblin - made knives, crayon cv, “simple is sometimes best” 1 male goblin - flying invention, made electric bomb 1 dwarf - intricate mental worker, made fabulous cross bow with barbs that splayed out\medskip
Start in 2 days for graduate program\medskip
KOLO LAB Hiring Initiative\medskip
2 assistants 1 Halfling - Professional cook, grinding inventions 1 Male goblin, bin man\medskip
At this point, everything is just a mess.\medskip
What is this game, even?\medskip
Zippy the gnome turns up at the Garygang Hideout. Apparently, Fishy called him. He’s a gnome, but he sounds like a Gabrin. Cultural Appropriation.\medskip
He, understandably, hates Pilch.\medskip
He can’t remember why the Church tried to kill him. It’s probably due to his alcoholism.\medskip
Kolo gives him that stuff that burnt down the pub that time.\medskip
He loves it.\medskip
He doesn’t have anything helpful to say.\medskip
Except that Pilch definitely got everyone killed.\medskip
We’re going with Lillian.\medskip
Lillian is helf-elf.\medskip
Lillian is the Trainer rank.\medskip
Lillian is not the best.\medskip
Lillian is probably alive.\medskip
Lillian is kind-hearted.\medskip
Estoban and Dougal are still alive, but are dicks, I reckon. Dougal is a Pastor now. Estoban is Zoro now, carving people up.\medskip
The workshop and labs are completely set up during the background of the Garystablishment.\medskip
Delilah pops off to meet The Jennys, to give in her month-long quest. Good for her.\medskip
IT’S OFFICIAL The Party has a name now. We are GARY. Garys Against Religion, Yo.
