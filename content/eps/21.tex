\subsection{Episode 21: Of Kokaine and Kevlar}
\DndDropCapLine{O}ur “heroes” are sleeping in a broken house like little bitches, when all of a sudden this big old bear and a load of worgs and goblins and horses and other shit comes at them out of the night..\medskip
Esme is all over it and ready to maim, reaches into her bag and pulls out some weird looking backpacks for Gary and Pilch and a little something for the baddies. She throws it at them, it goes bang and some goblins and a horse get evaporated..\medskip
Fishwank gets on the back of his wolf, with Kolo tucked underneath his arm. Kolo realises he’s going to try and move away from the badguys and immediately gets off the wolf as Fishwank rides away into the night, and is the fucking worst..\medskip
Gary thinks there’s been a terrible misunderstanding, and asks the badguys if he can help them..\medskip
Rocky shoots some shit..\medskip
The bear runs right up to Gary, who asks how he can help. After seeing one of them shoot at Esme, Gary hits a bad dog of a cliff..\medskip
There’s some shit that happens. People shoot things..\medskip
There’s forcefields and guns. It’s… really hectic… which is why it’s not described in great detail here….\medskip
Fishwank’s riding around on a wolf. Gary gets eaten by a bear and falls down. The wolf gets covered in ice, but the bear don’t care and goes over there to give Kolo his share while he’s unaware. This bear has a huge warpick and it’s making the gang real sad and injured..\medskip
Esme runs all the way over to Gary to wake him up with her fancy electricity gun. He’s fine, guys. He’s always fine. He takes a load of drugs and gets real angry..\medskip
Fishwank actually walks towards an enemy for once. And hits him with his sword..\medskip
Kolo hits the bear with an arrow, Gary accidentally hugs him, and Rocky shoots at him. The whole gang are working together..\medskip
The bear really wants to kill Kolo, and everyone hits him while he’s looking the other way..\medskip
The bear falls down and Gary gets annoyed that he didn’t get to kill it because of drugs. Gary brings the bear back and it immediately kills him. Then it tries to kill the wolf, but it dies because it’s spikey. It’s a real clusterfuck. What the fuck, Gary?.\medskip
Looting of the bear happens muchly..\medskip
Kolo and Exme interrogate a rezzed goblin, cutting off his fingers - excellent start. They let him free, but they have to promise to only try to kill them if he chooses to..\medskip
We don’t have long due to Athena? Coming to screw up the farm..\medskip
Something something emancipated all the goblins. Something something don’t have enough time for a long rest..\medskip
According to the fingerless gabrin, there’s no time to waste, and we should all hurry to the place before everyone dies. Everyone’s real fucked up, and all used up, but they don’t really have a choice. Gary wants to talk to everyone..\medskip
The gang arrive at the farm. Gary tells everyone that there’s no hope of survival and they’re all going to die. The people seem unwilling to abandon their home. Fishwank smears shit on his face. Kolo starts setting traps..\medskip
A plan is hatched to set fire to the farm so that the Varg think it’s already raided..\medskip
Gary tries to kidnap a child. Either the parents can follow him when he takes the child, or it will be the only survivor of the slaughter that is now unavoidable..\medskip
Fishwank sets a tent on fire..\medskip
Esme seems more concerned with the goblin’s fingers..\medskip
The raven flies off to see if it can see anything..\medskip
Rocky goes inside the house and tries to set fire to the kitchen. He gets thrown out by the burly farmer’s wife. He tries to set fire to the outside of the house as the Gabrins try and stop him. Gary climbs into the chicken coop with the child..\medskip
Kolo gives Fishwank 500 ball-bearings. Fishwank wants to put them up his anus for sexual pleasure..\medskip
Kolo racks up some pre-fight lines for Gary. Everyone rushes around trying to set up traps..\medskip
Gary instructs the child to stay quiet in the chicken coop until it sees its family die and then run into the countryside and survive..\medskip
The raven flies back and warns of an approaching party to the south. Shit’s about to get real..\medskip
Gary takes a moment to develop a chemical dependency on the Gabrin shit..\medskip
It is time..\medskip
The woman on the tiger turns up, as well as a load of other fuckers from all over the place..\medskip
Gary tries to diplomacy but is way too fucking high right now..\medskip
We’re all going to die..\medskip
Esme kills a horse. First blood. It will not be the last..\medskip
Pilch tries to set fire to a tiger. It kind of works. The area of pitch catches, and there’s now some fire. The tiger baulks at the flames and the woman jumps across them to come at Gary with 2 swords. Gary immediately falls down. Great work, guys..\medskip
Rocky shoots a guy..\medskip
Horses run around..\medskip
All the Kokaine in Gary’s bloodstream brings him back to consciousness. He plays dead, despite the fact that all he wants to do is take more Koke..\medskip
Everyone else is up trees, really..\medskip
The wolf runs out the tent it was in, and tries to do something complicated. It fails..\medskip
Fishwank gets killed by the sword, but then because of that thing he does sometimes, he doesn’t after all. Then the tiger tries to kill him, but it somehow doesn’t..\medskip
Rocky is Bolstered Against Damage..\medskip
He shrugs off some attacks, jumps over a fence and fails to shoot a guy..\medskip
Esme doesn’t quite fall out a tree. She gets hit by an arrow, but is also Bolstered Against Damage, so is fine..\medskip
Gary is still laying on the ground, pretending to be dead, desperately trying to not ruin the illusion by taking more Kokaine..\medskip
Esme kills another horse..\medskip
Fishwank casts darkness, as per usche. The wolf knocks the woman over. The one who used to be on the tiger. The tiger, despite it being dark, does not get confused and go to sleep..\medskip
People love being Bolstered Against Damage..\medskip
Gary is in the darkness, but has no idea what’s going on and assumes he has died. He goes for a nice calm walk through the afterlife..\medskip
Suddenly, everyone sees Kolo..\medskip
The tiger gets scared and runs away..\medskip
Gary walks out of the darkness, realises he’s not dead and that the battle’s still on. He takes the Koke and sprints off round the back somewhere..\medskip
Pilch carries on hitting the woman. He suddenly realises it should have been doing more all this time. The woman runs away and hides behind a tree. Kolo was definitely right to be scared of this woman..\medskip
The tiger tries to eat Esme. It does not..\medskip
All the guys on horses surround Kolo’s tree and try and murder him. Luckily, he is Bolstered Against Damage..\medskip
Rocky tries to homealone some bitches. Also he shoots them with a gun..\medskip
Some bitches fall over on some fucking ballbearings..\medskip
Gary runs over to the farmhouse and starts unbarricading a window. Esme shoots a tiger and then disappears into the darkness..\medskip
The darkness disappears into Pilch’s scabbard. Pilch goes to stab that woman, only to find out that she’s nowhere to be seen (she’s hidden behind a tree). He stabs the tiger..\medskip
The tiger dies..\medskip
In a rage the woman runs out, and attacks Pilch while h’s looking the other way. She accidentally impales herself on his spikey ice armour..\medskip
Everything’s going to be fine..\medskip
Gary does not know this and starts leading everyone in the farmhouse out the back way, regretfully inform them that everyone’s dead and their farm is lost..\medskip
Everyone else finishes off the last few horse people with a mixture of bows, guns and rolling logs..\medskip
The battle is over..\medskip
No one’s dead..\medskip
Except that no one knows that Gary isn’t dead, because of the darkness..\medskip
Pilch knows, but he is being a dick..\medskip
He robs the house instead..\medskip
Kolo is distraught at Gary’s death, but consoles himself with a bit of tiger dissection..\medskip
Gary is long gone, with all the farm people, except the small child who he was trying to protect in the first place. He doesn’t really know how to rescue them, and asks them if they have any ideas..\medskip
The Gabrins can’t find anything, but Fishwank uses his things..\medskip
Kolo rides the wolf to wear the raven saw Gary and the Farm People..\medskip
There’s a beautiful reunion and it turns out no one’s dead. Not even Fishy. You can’t have everything..\medskip
Gary says he doesn’t want to do any more Kokaine. Kolo disagrees.
