\DndDropCapLine{L}ast wewek we just about escaped from the castle and we flew away of all things on a goiant robot eagle and hahahaha burnie was lamost the king but he managed to find usd and not get disocvered in hsi tricksiness. Romjiiro hasnt been so happy about us accidentally killing his gf but its okay bcousse myron managed to be alive. We have put him in the hospital, so we will lleft him restt for a bit.\medskip

It was time for us to gather the army people so went to go and drop off the mans son. The dad was very impresesed wthat we hadd bought him all the way home so he agreed for us to have borrow of his 500 horsemen. Kolo decieded he was going to go to the battefiled now and get ready but then he felt really tired aso we went back to town to relax. Rippy awasnt so happy with the room he got so he got a nicer one with turnips on the pillow and everythign. We had some pretty nice sacks.\medskip

I lite a sigarette and loofk out at the mornning sun. The village is quiet quiet, the heavy bustle and hustle of the day yet to emerge like the mothetr bird ermgning from the nest hole to feedd her eggs, grnating them the sterngth to face the day. The horns were sounding to tell everyone that it was time to be in battle. Mr noble gave us his cousin to lead the horsemen and he was named Jakuno. He seemd brave. I could not wait to see new stanri. We set off at a brisk pace to try and make our way to be in time and of use. wE HAD gotten to about 6/8ths of the way there and there was a curious smell in the air and it was the smeel of a village being on fire. It was probably mercernaries. THe cousin did notw atn to help but we knew it was the right thing to do so we went therer. Hopefulyl this would have no bad consequences. The viallge was full of 7 men taking the women and the childrene, We charged firing away all togethehr screaming and shoutinging. No rapes for you today gentlemean. They had a lady leading gthem which was positive in a way but also they were evil so not all gooodd. Kolo murdered her through the eye with some nimble horesmanship work. I horsed my way over the dead woman and my masdk came doewn and I shouted at them that there would not even be a second chanse to live if they did not leave now and I used my deepest voice. Burnie stpped up and they fleed. I told burnie to go emancipate the village and kolo looted the lady boss. We got a nice sword. Burnie addessed the town and emancipated them and told them about our client lady inochi.\medskip

Kolo went into a bush. Then he became the bush.\medskip

We headed furioulsy to the batttle. Kolos horse was not happy to have a bush riding her. We finalyl caem to the battle and voer the hill we could see th raging maelstrom of war, both side heaavily engaged all fighting. Kolo went to be a bush and we all went to hte battle campp. Lady imicho awas sending her people in aleready. I pressed my arm device and suddenyl I saw stanrri!!. We went stragiht for himm (apart form kolo who is a bush). We did bear huggss. He looked so good inhis new bear metal clothes.\medskip

Lady imciho was there and also there was a lady who was on a uniocrn and is the angel of masuda. She was amazing. WE headed intot he battle, rippy and me raining bulelts down onto the oppostie team, and we were so inspriing everyone else followed us in. Althghh a lot of them were looking tiered. The pedants made a gap for us knowing that there part was done. The angel and the black lady went straight to it. I straddled stanri and kolo bushed in. Rippy was all singing and making us feel good. The horsemen ran in and strated hitting us loadss. Burnie got a shield and strated protecting rippy. The agnel was killing it. Noone could even really still believe there was a unicorn here. Swrds kept swinigng but they could hardly even touch us. This had to be in the bag thought burnie. Rippy took a moment to charm the horseman in front of him then ran away bravely all the while singing his inspiring song. I looked over and saw the black knights tiger sink its clawsinto the unicorns neck dropping it down to the ground. Poor horsey. Stanri bravely keapt into action and picked the angel up to continue her fight (he got a little pat off her to say thank you which I think he enjoyedd quite a bit). Kolo the bush finished off the tiger with an arrow threw the throat. I got wrecked by one of the horseymen, really bad, threw me for a loop.\medskip

Imicho flared with anger and just decmiated anagya and just stabsed straight threw his neck and was like “im sorry brother it had to be so”. Brutal. Everything looked blurry. Burnie ran over covered iin mud and like 5 men staretd attacking him but not a one could hit his burly frame. The angel attacked the knight again and almost killed him almost. Stanri went super stanri mode and mauled hi to death with his cute little jaws, disemboewelling himand leeting his blood run into the snow. I finally managed to hit someone :(\medskip

With their leader dead,the horsemen lay down their horses. Imicho was very regential and told them all they were very noble and the fight was over. Brunie quickly went over to the unicorn and managed to make it better. The angel was very grateful.\medskip

We headed back to camp an it was nice because everyone was friendes now and we all made one big camp to share. Imicho did a funeral for her brother and buried him with hnours on the battefiled where he felel. A few horus later after we ate and stuff imichio came over to say hello and she also said we were the ronin she had hired and told us our unconventional ways wer euseful and she thanked us. She said there is still like some way to go but that we will be there when she gets to go to masuda. Then a little boy came up and there was exciting and strange news and it seeemed that here two brothers had a fight with eachother instead of attacking us while we were down and she wanted to ask us one more favour. She needed us to go to the batttele field and she wanted us to be war correspondents. Burnie agreed for us which was a bit presumptious. It was a very long way away to that next battle. Burnie asked for daisuke to come with us. Buzzkkill. Burnie asked for pultices of healing and kolo just shot him daggers. I asked the little boy if we had any messages and we DID from the airship and it said “string of expletives…. Pregnancy rage….. You fucking bastards you left me here you put this inside me riphard why have you done this to me.”. Andalso rubrix sensei sent a message that said “airship repairs going well, ready for flight any updates requested? How is getting to masuda?” p.s. Hope die investigations going well”. I did a quick back of the map calculation and we decided we could tell the airship to come meet us at X on the map. I asked rippy if he wanted to write anything to delilah. He just stared blankly into space. We collectively wrote a message for him “I love you delilah. Hope the baby is well and am really happy we are doing ths. I hope you agve a caesection so your lady parts are all still good. I hope it is twins or quaduplets or nice things like that. I barely touched the orc woman with cancer”. Rippy didnt disapprove the message so we sent it on the way. We headed off to the meeting point.\medskip

On the way kolo gave me some plans for a straight line. But they were already in stanris boot and kolo finally had his new arrows of power. Burnie had a request for touching people but hoped he could do it at distance but his idea was ridiculous. I didn’t even have time to explain to him why he was so wrong. I was worried about the wind and my claculations. I took some time on on 4 day journey to study the cube. It tried to shut me out but i managaed to sort that out. Suddenyl a door appeared next to me. It was just flat. Weird. I knocked on it and the door opened. It was a lovely little cottage inside!!! Inside there was a little humanoid shimmering servant, He bowed and i bowed and kolo bowed then we decided we would have a little rest and rippy said he would watch out for the airship. Burnie looked out of the window and saw a field of golden corn reaching out to forever. He mucked about with some coins and then dreamed about a bedroom and found it. I was concerned about the airship, and i noticed that the map was bit sticky and it was folded in a bit. We went for a rest. 8 hrs later we saw the airship arriving on the way.\medskip

The airship arrived and had also picked up myron on the way, which was good and was not an oversight that we almost missed. All the reapirs looked great and it was flying like a beauty. Delilah was visibly pregnant now (4 months maybe). She ran and hugged riphard and was crying everywhere and riphard looked very happy. Burnie wanted to go and pick up his orc women but noone else wanted to do that. Delilah looked so pretty and plump. Rubix ssensei did not look so well. He was pleased with our porgress and was so wise and kind. Kolo told him about the filtration system and rubrixs sensei laughed and then coughed and kolo gave him some elixir and it was sad because he said he was not doing so well. Rubirxs sensei said he might burn his pricture books that gabrins were not allowed to see.\medskip

We lifted our anchor and we took off sialing to the west. The good airship Gary taking us to where we needed to go….\medskip

We arrived at the battlefield and it was not good. Dead bodies were littered everywehere. Hundred and hundred and tens. I noticed all of the dead had one colour. Burnie and kolo were sniffing the air, with a confused lok on theier face. Burnie whispered a single word.”gunpowder”. Daisuke was perturbed and burnie was upset his idea was taken. Daisuk ethgouth the honour was not good. He explained that vikkahanos men had not had a good time of things (they were dead). Daisuke said “honour is important”. Kolo coldly said “honour was important”. Burnie was pertuerbde and uncle kolo said he had a plan that involed blowing somethign up that wa very large. He wanted to blow up their black powedr supplies. Brunie decided we should take some of the bodies back and take them back to lady isoko so that we can show her what she is going to be facign now. Kolo investigated and found the bullet holes were quite small and we though it is probably a musket type of thing. Not too advanced. Volume over quality. Evrye pesaant a musketter.\medskip

We got in the ship and flew back to fukiniro to deliver our grim news…..\medskip

\textbf{Epilogue}\medskip

Myria sat on the river bank and watched the water. She considered the gentle flow and sadly looked back at her life. It had been two weeks since her diagnosis from the dwarven doctor. She still couldn’t quite bring herself to believe it. Cancer. One little word that carried so much weight. What had she done to deserve this? She’d been a good concubine. She’d exercised and tried to maintain a healthy diet. But that hadn’t been enough had it. A bluebird settled down on the bank next to her and looked up at her with a curious tilt of the head. To be that bird, she thought, care free and able to just fly away from its problems. The things she had always wanted to do but never gotten the chance. To explore the south end of the cave, to learn to tap dance, to rise up the ranks to the point of owning her own harem. These were things she would never be able to accomplish now. Why her? There was no use asking she thought. Sometimes bad things just happen to good orcs and that was how the world worked. Had she ever really been in love? Sure there was Urk’thal the Flayer, the one orc who would always make an effort to look her in the eye as he unleashed his lust inside her, but he was never the type to commit. Other than that, she did not think she had ever experienced the excitement of knowing someone at that most intimate level. A single tear rolled down her face. Why me….\medskip
