\subsection{Episode 18: Why Do You Guild Me Up?}
\DndDropCapLine{T}here once was a Pastor named Riphard, who played his pipes so dam hard, When asked to relent, He’d bend over and vent, All the gas from his inner intestard.\medskip

Stanri you really are a wicked little bearbot. Why must you infuriate me so. Well nevermind that. The big news of the day is we have finally arrived at Hope’s Rest and it is wonderful! We are staying in a very fancy place called the Petite Ferret. We went downstairs to find Gary sleeping in the bar. He was not very happy because he had experienced too much beer for the first time. His screams reminded me of kolo and mine’s first drink when we were 4. Gary had a strange piece of paper covering his eyes. Kolo tried to give him his famous hangover cure (the one made of virgins and silt, very effective but oh my the diarrhea). The mysterious note was from a stranger called P but it turns out it was just Wanker being obtuse…. Stupid manager not getting enough pillows.\medskip

We left Riphard and Delilah to their lust. I can’t imagine either one is enjoying it really, but if it helps them deal with their unhealthy sexual attractions to their parents then I suppose it is okay. We followed Gary to this mystery meeting. It was very busy in the city and SO many peoples. We had to sit on Gary just to see. Fishy was nowhere to be seen and we were very vexed with him for running out last night. We managed to get a taxi and eventually Gary managed to figure out where we were going based on navigating by people wearing hats. We eventually came to a big brick building where Gary decided we should just stand still, by all accounts his raisin dettre. Kolo took the opportunity to kill Fishy’s bird, by all accounts his raisin dettre. Kolo knocked on the brick building’s door and we were greeted by an old, cabbagey man called Archibald. He promised much bacons and eggses. “We learn as we try”. Motivational indeed. They even had a cat nailed to the wall. Archibald told us that we were in the bookburner’s society building. Or at least it used to be. They used to work for the church and were mercenaries. They hunted down heretical texts and burnt them. Basically what Fishy used to do for a living before he died.\medskip

O M G THIS BUILDING HAS FIREPOLES!!!! I used it at least 20 times over and over. So much fun!!! Kolo says he talked to Archibald and asked about the building and the book burners. He says he lives with his son which I imagine is quite a burden. He says the man didn’t really understand why a book should be burned. Whatever. Gary wanted to know about if printing presses existed. Archibald said that the book burners stopped being book burners because the church thought that the book burners were hiding thing from the church and the church thought the book burners were hiding books and not burning them then the church shut down the book burners and hunted them down and the book burners that are not hunted down are hiding. Something about the building being in dispute with some guild master, gosh this pole is fun! Gary wanted to know about hidden books but Archibald was pretending not to know. Maybe the vault? Who cares, this pole amirite? Although I was sick everywhere. Kolo was very upset with Archibald’s disrespect so he knockerbackered him. I had a word with him and i think he understands not to disrespect 8 year old gabrins anymore.\medskip

We went to the vault. Fishy seemed sad about the furnace and cried some tears. Archibald opened the lock on the vault and Gary tried to help. He threw up my favorite spanner. I had been missing that for weeks :( But you can’t stay angry at that expressionless stone visage. We all managed to get the door open with “TEAMWORK”. The chest in the vault were empty. Quite the anticlimax. We went up to the third floor and the pole was even higher!!!!! It turns out that the building is up for repossession. I had a good idea to steal the building and sell it so we could buy a building. Fishy suggested we could just keep the building, which made embarrassingly good sense. He patted me on the head. He won’t do it again. Kolo says I was sat on on the head by a treepottamus?\medskip

Gary tried to use the pole but he forgot to hold onto the pole. It was not a good look for him sprawled out on the ground floor like that. We will have to get archibald to clean up and fix the floor. We tried to decide how to get the building into our name. Kolo had lots of good business ideas and “strategies” and Fishy said his friend Zippy might be coming over. We had a big talk about what we could do. It turns out that the guilds might get upset if we do unlicensed work. Gary proposed to start a Gary guild. Everyone knows a lot of Gary’s so this idea may not be as stupid as it sounds. Kolo and I decided to go and see the maker’s guild. I made Archibald go and strip out the third floor for a new workshop and gave Pilchy’s bird some job adverts. [Gary runs for a while wherever looking for someone to chat to. He finds a place that has scones and jam. He tries to encourage an old man to start a Gary guild. Juniper gives Gary plenty of advice of the various job opportunities that exist. He leaves Juniper a card that is actually a real card of course, not just a hastily written scrap of paper. “Djago”. Gary lets him know to shout him if he ever needs him]\medskip

[Pilchy blacks up and arrives at the Jolly Giant, a “robust” sized tavern. He meets a barman with a red mohawk. Fishy manages to deceive the man into thinking he is a jamaican stereotype. He needs to find Larry. “Fruity drink is for fruity man”. Some low level homoerotic flirting. Pilch tries to kiss the man. The man is not happy and headbutts his “nancy” face. Pilch wakes up outside the giant. ]\medskip

Kolo and I took one of the fancy taxis to the guild of making. It sat on a roundabout what a thing! We entered the huge ornate doors and looked at all the butlers. We managed to push our way to the front of the queue and got the attention of the odd glasses lady. The lady kept asking about what guild to join which seemed silly because I am an inventor. The lady gave us some forms and Kolo filled them in with our specialities. Medicines for general and public use, alleviators of mind and body. And not weapons on death, but crowd control devices and general self defense paraphernalia. We pushed our way to the front of the queue and handed in our forms. She directed us to somewhere else. Kolo is taking it over. Kolo hands her a piece of paper? And we go to the guilds of inventors and apothecists. We got the maps and went over.\medskip

[ Gary heads back to the empty fire station. He tries to find out where the police station is. He is going to join the police and finds the GOPS building. He applies to join through the standard tests. He can lift over 120 pounds. He is a paragon of justice. He swears to uphold the law in everything he does. This seems to be all that is necessary. Gary is able to draw three panel comics with remarkable speed instead of signatures. Most feature the popular cat ‘Triplicate’ who likes pizza and is by all accounts whimsical. That apparently is all that needs to be done to become a police officer. He meets his new partner, a half orc who likes his tea with two sugars in an upside down police helmet. Also whimsical. Gary suits up and gets a double sized, long sword sized truncheon. Djago goes on his first patrol after getting a pan beaten onto his head. ]\medskip

[Pilch applies a new disguise. Apparently Stephen also has a gf irl. Who’d have thunk? The barman thinks this man has a similar voice but Pilch says it was actually his voice twin. A clever lie. Pilch calls him wanker. Pilch has an inconsistent lisp and asks a lot about warry, his old friend. It seems as if warry has been gone for a while, looked disheveled and was not wearing pants last time he was here. We miss Otoria. There is some pedantisism about pants vs trousers. Warry is long gone. Any other book burners here Pilch asks, mentioning disguises which is bold. Old Burny Sanders used to come in a lot ranting and raving, but he left too. All the book burners gone. Well actually Burny was hung. Lot’s other dead. Pilch mocks the man’s masculinity and his sword axe. “Sword is phallic, sword is like an extension of one’s cock. You gotta have a sword or you ain’t a man. Buy my sword man.” Pilch wakes up half an hour later bleeding severely in a gutter. ]\medskip

The league of inventors. A blackened, iron wrought building belching smoke. Kolo knocked to let us in and we met a gnomish man who was very eager. I must say, he was a little rude about me being a gabrin inventor. I ordered their most expensive drink to try and hurt them because they hurt me. Theobald the gnome tutor discussed the guild. It was all quite dull. I was lead into a small laboratory for my test. It was quite an exciting room with lots of bits and pieces. The gnome left saying he would be back in twenty minutes and needed to be impressed. I decided to just rig up a couple of my old portable forcefields and create a massive barrage of weaponry. The poor gnome was a little shocked but he agreed that the work was of merit. How “wonderful” to be worthy of this gnome’s approval (that is sarcasm like Kolo has been teaching me). We left with a 10\% deal in place and a license to invent. Now to get our apothecary….\medskip
