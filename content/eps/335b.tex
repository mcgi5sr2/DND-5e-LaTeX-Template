\subsection{Episode 33.5b: Huey Shitpirate and the News}
\DndDropCapLine{W}e wake up back on the starship, everyone is very confused which is pretty normal when you’ve just had an out of body experience. The people complained about the sound of my typing but then they realised that the 4th wall doesn’t exist so we got back to looking out of the window at space. The party remembered that they went into a magical storm of hellfire and magic where Mark helped them to create a time portal which would siphon the energy off and save the ship. I watch the players talking about who I am and explain that the universe hates them. We are in virtual reality in order to then travel into the past. It’s all very confusing…for them. The goblins are not very good at dealing with these metaphysical truths and have passed out. We go back…to the past! Because going back to the future would make no fucking sense. Back in the sewers we are in a pile of corpses of perfectly innocent people who we killed. We don’t care. Mr Motivator runs around in a circle through some corridors in a miracle of bad architecture. We go East because south and north are pointless circles, where we come upon a goblin carrying papers. Mr Motivator coaches him as he tries to run away but Sandi quickly tackles him. We get some info on the printing press before Bones shanks him. Its possibly a race thing because he might be Chinese or Mexican. People would comment but by this point it’s pretty much expected. Sandi continually changes accent because the universe is not used to being in a body. After travelling we end up at the press. The press is definitely evil and covered in skulls. There is a shit pirate, he has no nose, so how does he smell? Terribly. There are some more newspaper zombies, we could take them out by just taking the newspapers off them. We think about doing this. Mr. Motivator ignores the zombies and goes for the shit pirate because he seems interesting. He asks him how he smells. He doesn’t appreciate it. Bones immediately stabs a newspaper zombie and murders him. It was totally not needed. Sandi rips a paper in half and takes one out while disappointed with Bones. Exmeh wakes up in the not-real real world and finally decides to join in and puts the goggles on to join the others. Mr. Motivator goes to punch the shit pirate in the face but forgets that he has no nose and ends up throwing his stick off Treyvon is no longer too old for this shit. He still has a bit of Exmeh inside him and tries to beg the goblin for help but instead he asks the goblin if his mother smelled of elderberries. The brave shit pirate attempts to dominate the cook, but is so shit that he fails and tries to run away. Motivator and Treyvon ruthlessly murder some goblins in retribution. More goblins arrive to attempt to sneak up on us, but they are terrible and just can’t hit anything. Shit pirate commands Bones to stop. Bones is an idiot and actually listens to him. The shit pirate runs away again. As nobody can reach him we take our frustration out on the goblins. Somewhere deep inside Exmeh crys. Treyvon is really old and yet still has a big black wing which works just fine. He murders a goblin by slapping it with his wing. He keeps taking a pounding but they’re only goblins and he’s in a rage.\medskip

Sandi charges at the shit pirate, barging two goblins out of the way, but the shit pirate has long arms and just holds his hand out to stop her grappling him. Treyvon spreads his big black wings and runs up a pillar. Bones gives the shit pirate a hug and whispers sweet nothings into his ear about draining his blood. The shit pirate asks him politely to run away and he obliges because Bones is not a wise man, so he runs away out of the room. Sandi tries to follow him windmilling her arms but it’s completely ineffectual. Motivator goes on a motivational rampage and murders some people. Treyvon flies off the pole in a rage, murdering like a big murderbird does. Sandi gets asked to flee and also does because we are not very clever. Motivator chases him down and goes so fast he leaves reality momentarily. Treyvon starts eating a goblin. Somewhere in reality Exmeh feels very disgusted with herself. Bones goes anime style and dashes arms back, using the machinery to accelerate himself. He gets into combat and goes for a scalpel strike on the achilles tendon, but it misses after the replacement universe works out what is going on. Bones finally gets to his grips after taking several commands and avoids getting dominated. The party (except Trayvon who is eating a goblin) takes chase after the shit pirate down a sewer tunnel but motivator is still speedy and fresh, slickly greased with sweat. He chases him down and motivates him in the face. He’s unconscious. Bones makes his day even shittier by attempting to sever his tendons but it is not very. They check the book that the shit pirate was using, it’s “How to Make Fiends and Influence People”. Marcy takes the book to burn or not to burn? We talk to the shit pirate, he says he had a plan and blames us but he turns to dust before we can really care.\medskip

We go back for a debriefing: there are two things – there’s a bunch of stuff:\medskip
\begin{itemize}
\item A book on the gold list is on the black market, need to get it
\item The universities have lost some tissue samples
\item There’s a visiting arcanist – might have some things
\item Jenny’s – might be going to war over the
\end{itemize}
Trayvon goes on a rant about people not insulting him. Nobody listens. He’s still a crow.
