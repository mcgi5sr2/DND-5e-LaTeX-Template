\section{Episode 53: Vaulted Feelings}

\medskip

\DndDropCapLine{R}ecap - left the tavern, took a long time to get to the mine. Got to the mine. Went down into the depths - met some delvers - tried to recruit them. No dice. There’s 3 settlements/shitholes/townships/smallerthanthat places down here - tent towns. Went and picked up a miner (nopaedo). Met an old lady that made them tea. Tried to get her to rebel against the upper world. Riphards uncle and Lilith are both down here. Went to a camp, talked to a blacksmith - told them where L and RU (Targon Hardthrust) had been. Old hardthrusts lived under the earth, found a vault-type-thing. Targon had an arrow in his belly.\medskip

We’re in a mine! How’d we get here?! Oh that’s right. Gotta stop day-dreaming. There’s a smell of burned flesh… Ah - kolo gave the Dwarf-man (Targon) some field medicine. Learning from the best. We chingwag with the old Hardstone, (or was it hardthrust?) and put him on Stanri - This is a Hardstonethrust vault of some description. Stanri becomes a bridge over some dodgey chalksidian (obsidian disguised to look like chalk - Riphard). ~ so that we don’t fall into the bowely below. Kolo and Myron walk into an obviously trapped room. See no traps. Open a trapped chest. Get locked into the room and gassed. Myron beasts it, Kolo almost dies. Riphard farts on Kolo to hope it works. Exme shocks the Kolo. He gets better.\medskip

We find a gap. I fail to throw the bear across it, old age must be getting to me. Myron walks on air with his fancy shoes, and holds a rope. Kolo climbs the rope across, but Myron fails and we almost lose Kolo, save for Bearvine intervention. We leave Myron to his fate, trapped on the island, and me and Exme and Riphard go to a room with dwarvern characters - which I can read! Ma and Pa always said that dwarvish was useful, I figured it was just one of those national pride things, and kinda resented them for making me learn it. Guess it’s not so dumb now!\medskip

There’s a mural with sentences, and runes on the floor. One of those “don’t step on the cracks” things - and also all the wrong runes as there’s poison darts everywhere. I go looking for a chest Myron stole earlier to create a shield and brute force the puzzle, until Exme points out that there’s spelling errors in all the names. Lapin, Ametryst, Paradot, Oryx, Garnot. Derp. We step the pattern of “Shine”.(because there wasn’t an E near after the H. Kolo pulls the lever. And then runs through the dart trap… Shoddy dwarven constructions - should have switched off the countermeasure once the puzzle was solved!\medskip

We get to a hole. Myron shouts down it. A tentacle completely fails to grab him. Welp, that happened. We come to an area with slippery emerald. Wait, glass with a weird liquid. Super slippery, down into the spikes we go! Stanri breaks our falls! We go to a chamber with a statue. The statue comes alive. It slows the balls out of me and Myron - Exme blows the fuck out of it - I’m dodging in place. Exme uses the die to buff all our stuff. It wasn’t needed. Riphard kills it.\medskip

We go into a chamber and find gold and weapons. Taragon is racist. Kolo kills him and starts eating his liver. I shock him - He’s gone feral! I drag Targon’s corpse away to loot and dispose of - why does every culture canibalise their dead? I get a good whip+1/+1 - Really nice hand crossbow (+2/+2) and a fancy cloak. Then me and kolo dump his body into the tentacle well. I pretend to eat a chunk, smearing blood on my chin, Dwarf cannibal tradition. Loads of cash, like 7k, 3k of that in gems, and a bunch of axes and things. Couple nice crossbows +2/+2, and about 3 waraxes +1+1, with some less good stuff.\medskip

We go back to the last gasp camp and confuse the blacksmith, and the guy with a dodgey leg. We sleep, some people cry for Kolo, no one crys for Rips uncle. It’s an uneasy rest. We go in search of Lillith in the morning. We eventually get to a mining camp, and get ambushed by mongoloids. Wait, no, troglodytes. We kill them quickly. Stanri is a train. We come across a pair of dicks, gas-breathing Gorgons. They breath hot gas at us. Kolo starts getting stoned. Kolo is no longer stoned. We focus the right-side. Myron, me and Rip start turning to stone - I shrug it off.\medskip

I slice the first (already weakened) one to bits, Stanri demolishes the second. We’ve got two stoned companions. Lilith is barrel. She tells us there’s an under-mine that might have the excallibrum. But we’ve got two stone-shaped companions to try and help out.\medskip
