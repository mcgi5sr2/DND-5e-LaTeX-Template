\subsection{Episode 16: I'll Bite your facking face off}
\DndDropCapLine{E}xme has built some bitching chariots out of stuff she just had hanging around. One’s a cyber-boss from the future, with nitro-boost and everything, and a smaller jousting one for Kolo.\medskip
Kolo fails at convincing any of the animals to do anything gets bitten by a raptor and insulted by a horse - Pilch becomes Papa Lazarizzz - the blackfaced charletan. He sells a sword to the humans, disarming them of their Lance - little do they know his plans…\medskip
Delilah and Kolo discuss rules. Kolo contemplates suicide for the win, but doesn’t. He also necks a bunch of drugs.\medskip
Rules: 3 point for helmet 2 points for KO 1 point for disarming\medskip
Yellow and Red raptors\medskip
Blue, Pink and Orange (Spancer) Charriots\medskip
There’s also a mystery green charriot (the colour orange actually is) because the universe is colourblind. Green and orange are opposite in Velterra.\medskip
BirdyRaptor comboa attacks spancers, spancers responds by disarming them (avec Pilch’s sword)\medskip
Kolo stays still and attempts to shoot them with his bow - so many boos.\medskip
Howlov knocks prone the green’s horse when it attacks. Spancers horse is prone but not yet completely fucked.\medskip
Others move around, achieve little.\medskip
Kolo sets prone spancers on fire with firewater, then runs away, Another spancers chariot then strikes the helmet off of prone spancers in their disabled state.\medskip
Birdy raptor charges Kolo and co, but Howlov holds his ground.\medskip
Another bird raptor gets fucked hard by the spancers.\medskip
Kolo fucks those spancers with his lance, taking off the helmet.\medskip
BirdyRaptors lose control and then falls into a pit. Lol.\medskip
Kolo then delivers the coup de gras on the prone and on fire spancer chariot team.\medskip
Remaining spancer kills the last of the BridyRaptor teams.\medskip
Kolo runs pink into the pit by exploding it with an exmeh special boomstick\medskip
And that’s why cultural diversity is like a rainbow… of death.\medskip
Gary then rezzes people.Kolo dives into a pit to rob someone blind. Oh wait, he’s mutilating their corpse. That’s much worse.\medskip
Kolo got 9 points, BirdyRaptor teams 5 each, Spancers got a combined teams score of 1.\medskip
Kolo does the same chop chop to a nasty Raptor.\medskip
ONTO HORSEY RACES\medskip
Kolo cokes up a horse. Who gets really into the idea of racing and eating other horses faces.\medskip
Exme and Riphard get into their suped-up cyborg charriot.\medskip
6 chariots\medskip
3 Raptor - Tengu with various weaponry.\medskip
One spancer has net and trident, another has a sling - heavy duty sling. And a cattle prod.\medskip
The race starts.\medskip
Riphard’s coke-horse has… wheel spin? Ends up in last place due to kicking sand rather than pushing forward.\medskip
Starts to accelerate further forwards, overtaking Raptor 3.\medskip
There’s a ramp round the corner, Rip flies with un-dwarf like elegance and overtakes the tar-stuck raptor 2.\medskip
He shoots the sling-spancer for daring to throw a stone at him.\medskip
Exme blows the living shit out of the net spancer with a pair of weaponised fireworks from the SRA leader dude like months ago (are the fireworks even still good?)\medskip
The front Raptor drops oil in front of an fork - trying to force the team down the right path.\medskip
Pilch Minor illusions the image of a small child in front of the leading raptor Chariot. The raptor tries to eat the child, probably helping it run along.\medskip
Exme hits the red button - the horse gets a shot of nitro-adrenaline uber-brew. The horse shits itself and dies, broken legs, broken back by the charriot… exploded heart. The chariot gets flipped awesomely but the first raptor makes it through. Riphard then crawls through the line by himself, earning silver.\medskip
RIP horse.\medskip
Big ceremony. Has Gary convinced people of the way of no violence? No, the trophy is a fucking human skull with silver in it.\medskip
We feast, we’re happy. We go talk to the leaders.\medskip
Bird people are cool, they become our allies with Kolo discussing. We should send Quoth to find them if ever we need them.\medskip
Gary manages to piss off the spancer tribe leaders, but they’re ultimately not going to kill us, so that’s a win.\medskip
Basically, they both know we don’t like the church and might be our allies in future.\medskip
Riphard pisses off to the desert to think about this mad world like a big emo.\medskip
Kolo follows on Howlov - talks to Riphard about a money laundering and drug distributing operation. Also the sky is filled with snakes from goblin folk-lore.\medskip
Riphard is a massive anti-goblin racist, Kolo doesn’t understand business. They get to some sort of agreement.\medskip
Everyone sits around the fire, and nothing bad happens.
