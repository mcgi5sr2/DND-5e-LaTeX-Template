\DndDropCapLine{T}O GARY\medskip

The death of sensei has been hard, in fact so far life has been pretty hard. Only for a short period did I think we would be able to tame the beast of my dreams and nightmares. With such a thing we could lay the world low, and crush infidels where they stood, but you would have been against such things. Somehow you saw the good, where I could not. It is times like this when I miss you the most old old friend.\medskip

I was the blood from my hands, its become a cleansing ritual over the last week. Eat, sleep, repeat. The cycle is over now though, as we touch down in the Tom Ardy mountains. A bountiful land, full of Jeffs, and flowing water. The high methane levels are very high, and it seems to be affecting us all. Riphard keeps talking about how we gabrins are just going to end up as delvers. Esmerelda Quartz is born out a magical stone egg. Noscopy Limestone will be enough for me to pass as a dwarf. Disguises complete we head out to meet some rather noisy gold spear wielding guards.\medskip

\textbf{Sum total of Riphards knowledge of this place} \medskip

    Aunt Lazuli possibly mad

    Uncle Targon reprobate bit of an adventurer

    BlackSmith doesn't do real work, but buys work in. Tree DoorStone Fist

    Ex GF Denay Cocksure, bit of lass

    Favourite Pub The Short is Right, owned Jim Mansfield

    Sheanus RockGrinder politician\medskip

The guards seem pretty calm about the giant airship at first, and simply tell us to park it elsewhere. Its only through talking with them for over 10 seconds that I realise that they are complete arseholes, and that possibly Tom Hardy mountains are rule by **RACIST, BIGOTED, RICH, WORKSHY, SLAVERS** and that perhaps it would be safer to cleanse this place. A small voice in my head agrees that this is a most excellent idea. Its not your voice Gary, though many a time I wish it had been.\medskip

Exmerah comes off the boat and throws some serious freaking shade! Back from gallivanting around the world Exerah Quartz has returned with her retinue. Glorb Styron, Arbiter first class, is here for security. Bernald Sanders the paige boy. Thankfully not a half elf, but also thankfully he will die soon. These guards really are racist swine! Luckily these guards are such idiots because this isn’t making a lot of sense to me. Exmerah kindly offers to allow the guards to beat Bernald the slave. Sadly they are on duty, otherwise would have gone for it. If anyone else touches a hair on Bernald I will gut them like the balloon cows we over inflated. Bernald is my play thing, and not for general consumption.\medskip

Riphard decides that Delilah, who is now a beach ball, would be much safer aboard the airship. This solves the issue of her meeting his ex girls, and keeping the airship safe. Pretty shrewd Rips. I ask about shopping opportunities and have to skirt around the **slave** issue again, but am directed to a market place where hopefully I can get the animals I need for further testing.\medskip

It transpires that Riphard is dead, and in the news has been passed all over the Tom Hardy Mountains. Luckily it was only his neighbours house that went up in flames.... After a brief discussion of why the dwarves still use stone for their tabloids we move on to Bronson market.\medskip

On the way we have a big discussion about when to emancipate the slaves. For a change it seems that everyone is on board with this task, and its given high enough priority that we might actually do it. Although not so high as we get to do it now. On arrival to the market, it is a huge glitzy well maintained bazaar, with overpriced shit everywhere. The walkways are too thin to fit many people in, and its overcrowded as fuck. Also I notice that most shops are selling the same shit. Everything is covered in gold, but it doesn't seem that anything is actually made here, just all bought in. When I try to buy a cow a couple of pigs and a chicken the fucktard doesn't even know what they are. Apparently meat just arrives here!\medskip

Myron needs some smithing, for his very hard penis. Its a pretty place, as is the blacksmith, although its bereft of any real smithing tools or a forge. Other than a backlit paper mache forge. Styrofoam is on official business and after some kind of halberd.Spiro wants a polearm but with a shorter pole, so like a short polearm. The blacksmith says that the stabby part of his shotgun is utter tosh, the church has done him no favours. A Halberd from him could really help out. Myron pulls out his Journal, its a heartfelt rendition of how things have been going. Myron gets something that should be only for Halberds of Dunkirk, Its called peaky blinder, because it's shiny. No discount to the church here. This place blows goats.\medskip

Rips Uncle has become a Delver, Seaumus RockGrinder is the Bane of his existence, is now running a lot of the show around here. Lillian is somewhere around here. Who the fuck is Lillian? Exmerah has been working on the Rubrix Die, and has a unlocked some inspiring stuff.\medskip

After much discussion on the length and girth of dwarven members, we go to meet a stock trader by the name of Denay. Rips blags his way into her office. The room is full of awful portraits of her and the family. She thought Rip died in a massive house fire. But maybe that was the other house, or the summer home.\medskip

What the snikkety snaky side dick is going on around here. His dick gets stuck in the robe, but once its all the way out the reflection in the gold robes makes it look twice as thick. Nothing strange going except for the black robed human woman. As all humans look the same, hard to know if it was she looked like Myrons stick figure drawing or not. Either way she was looking for something secret down below, that isn’t her vajazzles.\medskip

Burmie is dwarfkin. That only makes it worse. RockGrinder is still a prick. The ginger piece of shit. Slimy politician bastard has been blackmailing Dinner plate. Rips uncle is a sad old bastard who is ashamed of losing all three of his family members. He has donned the black and gone down the mines. Nobody has ever come back from being a delver.\medskip

Lady Quartz has been far and wide getting slaves, and exploring new mining prospects. She grabs the nearest guard who sorry for himself does not know who she is. She demands that she is taken to the mayors office.\medskip

Somehow it all goes wrong and ends with the guards being called, and Burnie insinuating they are here for a police bust on the mayor and his paedophilic ways. Burnie finally gets the beating he deserves, but from someone else, I would say this is the final straw, but some dwarf fuck pulled that a while ago. As six of them maul him, while the other two try and eject us. I try to get her name on the list. Lady Quartz then goes to try and make an appointment. Tomorrow afternoon is the first appointment, however we are not going to go to that one! Burnie miraculously recovers from being beaten to the floor, enough to jump up and screams running at the door about how what his face is kiddy fiddler.\medskip

Rip takes the lead and returns to meet the mayor himself. After a short wait, he is allowed to meet mayor crock grime. Unbearded ginger dwarf with a purple robe, and a big gold chain around his neck. The Hardstone properties have fallen into disrepair.\medskip

When his uncle took to being a delver he lost all rights, and lost all eligible rights. To go and see his uncle he needs to fill out a visitors form, THIS GUY HAS TO DIE. While he is looking into the cabinet for the right forms, he spots Rips pouring poison into his drink. HE declines the drink as its no good for his gout. He convinces the secretary to hand deliver the form, while flashing a bit of dick. She recoils having seen his regular dick, not the show dick.\medskip

Myron and I both hate this place. Its decided that the whole of the tom hardy needs to be destroyed. Myron is super keen to go down into the mines. Stanri is diggin a hole in the middle of the street, throwing dirt everywhere.\medskip

We get to pub, it super hip, the stools are uncomfortable, and the tables are too small. The barkeep is not serving any shots, just cocktails. Burnie detonates the cocktail using the sparkler, its super dry and bitter. Rip buys a a Mad Max Fury road cocktail.\medskip

AS an aside it turns out that Burnie pisses with an erection and frequently gets it all over Myron, who has to watch. PTSD is a bad bitch to have to handle.\medskip

The dwarves are so rich, that there is literally no work for people, even the slaves just sit about doing nothing.\medskip

We get rooms, but they are all based on tom hardy pop stars. The forms are delivered by someone working for the secondary mayor Humphrey Pinkle Winkleton. Burney gets the guards numbers that were chasing him before 80081355 and 10000001.\medskip

Myron pitches his tent outside the front of the pub. Rips is up late filling out a form. Exmerah is digging with Stanri. Burnie goes off to the dentist.\medskip

I make the list, and check it twice, every-bodies naughty and nobodies nice. Its certainly not like it used to be Gary, and for that I am sorry. For what I do tomorrow.....\medskip
