\DndDropCapLine{E}xme, Kolo and Burnie move forward, stealthily. Rip comes up and completely distracts Burnie, who promptly falls into a pit. william wallace orcs hear the trap get sprung and come running, big dicks a swinging. Kolo hides, exme gets gang-banged. Myron and Kolo are playing table tennis. Myron hears exme dying, and runs up to help. Big daddy blue-balls runs up. Rip finally comes along too, and flops his dick out too. Burnie climbs up a thing and explodes an orc through his dick, dodging attacks as quick as possible.\medskip

Kolo is all alone. But he’s getting safer, casting spells and cracking viles on people. We slowly murderise the people, rip shoots one with a big thunderboom at one point. Blue balls damned sticky armor keeps blocking. We finally get him (Kolo killing blow!). Kolo goes scouts, we discover there’s bats and trolls up ahead, we stage a place to attack. Rip ruins the whole plan and moves forward, triggering a bunch of bats. Bats swarm, slowly die. Exme discovers stanri can counter-attack.\medskip

Bats dead, damned trolls show up. A lady with weapons and a man without. Toll man goes down quickly, but troll-queen is crazy hard to hurt. We finally get her through a huge-combo of everyone doing everything. We manage to have a nap, and then go for a wander.
