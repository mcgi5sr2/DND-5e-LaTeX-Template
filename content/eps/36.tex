\subsection{Episode 36: Memories of Otario}
\DndDropCapLine{E}xmerah is hiding stuff in the belly of the beast again. She is always up to things and looking funny at us these days.\medskip
Myron is surprised as we cross the border in kurato, but really wants to get all this orc killing done with. Bernie starts making a good point, about orcs being reasonable fellas and that perhaps diplomacy may be the better way forward. For a short period of time Myron seems to be on board, until he mentions baking, how would he know about that young orc lass who was great at baking? Myron just wants to go home, Bernie takes the hint and pretends to gallop off.\medskip
Everyone else is having a nice time fishing by the river, its fishing time. Time to get a fishing rod, Bernie helps with the language, as I really don’t know much beyond hallo!\medskip
MYron does not seem interested in the fishing at all, his loss. I get a lovely fishing rod, Bernie has a great hat, and looks super handsome with his duck robe and hat.\medskip
Myron goes searching for intel with DaiSuke, turns out this village hasn’t been hit that badly, but the others in the area have been wiped out/slaughtered/slash ongoing badness. Been going on for a while, makes one wonder why no one has done anything in the last few years about this orcs. They seem like a real menace. Myron promises to be the hero and go and sort out these orcs! Lets hope we don’t all die, perhaps Bernie is right and the orcs are totally rational and normal like Martha was.\medskip
We get some one way ponies, and a day later Myron jumps off a horse\medskip
“What will I see?” he sees three humps in sand…\medskip
And then tricks the humps into thinking he is jumping back onto his pony\medskip
Badadadadumdumdum\medskip
A wild set of sand daggers appear….. It doesn’t look good.\medskip
These things a massive and have a full set of awful teeth, this does not bother Myron, as he backflips off the pony flips his shield in front of him and lets the pain rain from his gun and bayonet combo. Its a big gun sandwich from the little man…\medskip
Stanri dumps the Gabrins, as the gears whirr and clash he shifts gear and bull rushes the nearest sand dagger. Its not super effective, and he releases a mechanical whine.\medskip
Bernie draws sword and makes off to intercept one of the sand daggers, to look at us we could be a band of roving heros, maybe rubrix was onto something, probably not tho he is super old. Also the sand dagger looks like its going to eat bernie so theres that..\medskip
Riphard pulls his gun, both of them, cleverly stepping behind me, next time I might help him with the shooting part tho, although tbf Exmerah was always the crack shot so perhaps she could school him some.\medskip
Boooooom, a whole lot of animal gets blown away, as does part of Myrons gun. This could be super bad news,\medskip
Must remember to notch then draw, the other way around doesn’t work. Luckily big Ol Stanri is smashing the sand dagger.\medskip
Bernie ask for help, “why don’t you do this one in?”\medskip
“Ill do you in!” I say adding in a whisper, “your back doors that is” he does look every inch the man he used to be.\medskip
Sand Daggers are every bit as dangerous as Otario once claimed, even the crocodile suit doesn’t stop the fearsome maws! Now the choice need be made, save myself or save Bernie. I know from experience what he would do! Exmeh makes the right choice and taps the big beast right between the mandibles! Rinse and repeat I believe! Unfortunately I drop another arrow, thats not great.\medskip
Myron looks a little upset over his gun breaking, and takes his sweet revenge by blowing the beasts head to pieces, before running off to punch another one, what a nutter!\medskip
Bernie changes his tune and starts courting Exmeh, I guess he is as fickle as he always was. Stanri bats the sand dagger as it goes to maul Riphard. Whip Crack goes its wuppy tale, and the beast was done. Bernie starts wielding Pilchs stabby sword, and pokes a lovely hole into one of the sand daggers as it lunges for him. Its like an emotional seesaw watching this guy!\medskip
Myron is clearly over taken by grief as his gun breaks, punching the floor. Perversely this seems to be the cue for the sand dagger to start burrowing. Nature crazy like that sometimes.\medskip
Riphard whips the dagger, and sets it all aglow, in pain i hope! Exmerahs blows a huge chunk off another sand dagger, luckily as i get my bow knocked out of my hand by Stanri who then paws it some. Before upper cutting the sand dagger, gutting it from tail to maw, stupid beast, now the bow is buried in fleshy bits.\medskip
The last sand dagger rears up from the ground behind us, ripping into my sister. She is blown off her feet and thrown to the floor like a rag doll, before the sand dagger pulls her under.\medskip
I dive in after Exmerah and go for my bow, at which point i realise i don’t have it so rip the point off my nearest thunderstone arrow and dash it under beast forcing it to the surface. Stanri then rips my sister from the monsters grasp.\medskip
Its then I see the monster face to face, hallo my tunnel bound friend.\medskip
Myron pre chews some lovely beef jerky for Exmerah, could it be love? Its certainly a lot of jerky for a wee gabrin.\medskip
Its still gabrin vs sand dagger down in the tunnel, I try and burn the bitch out but misjudge how potent rubrixs new concoction is, setting both of us to the flame before being extracted by my foot by big Stan. As bernie goes sword first slicing the big bad worm in two! Myron gets even more.\medskip
Words are shared, everyone did well, back slaps all around. Bernie makes some food, Myron and I go round and eat some bugs. Its strangely restorative. In the end we spend the night by the fire, Exmeh and I set to work. Fingers crossed I can remember rubrixs formulas, he was very exacting about measurements and how dangerous it was to get the order of them wrong. Exmeh seems well at home tinkering away, so I keep my head down too. She was always so good at this, whereas I just seem to burn myself and anything else. Bernie becomes aware of Exmehs manly explaining voice. Seems like we are all becoming friends here….\medskip
In the morning I show Myron my new jumping stone, he is impressed despite how much it hurts. When we look up to start finding the way to go next, we are surrounded by cowled figures on horses that seem more machine than man. They stare with some intent, as Myron brings the boom again firing into the air, killing some poor birds that were passing overhead. It seems these people can talk common, so we try and get to see their leader. They don’t have one, I put on her face, it didn’t help things and they all swords.\medskip
Some serious explaining goes down, and it the new visitors drop their cloaks and it turns out they are also those automatomic things that Otario was. Its time to share stories and eat jerky. Conrad made these lovely killer robot ladies.\medskip
It turns out Otario founded a movement of these sisters to emancipation, a crusade these lovely lady killer robots continue. Otario struck the first blow and so had to flee the country. Otario killed the freaking emperor, he was bad. But it started all of these current shinannigans.\medskip
Lots of words are had, some good, some less bad, Myron bringing up Lindedorf didn’t go down very well. Just before we leave I introduce the team, and they are hte Heatthrust scoiety\medskip
Lady Vashen\medskip
Lady Hirota\medskip
Lady Averio\medskip
So after much discussion, we agree to go and meet Konrad the builder after we have become Ronin ourselves. We gracefully hand over Otarios face, and request another built so we can claim that we have slain her, and gain the reknown for that. We also promise to make a big deal about our doing this proclaiming how the geishas are seeking freedom and autonomy. Hopefully stirring embers for a more full blooded rebellion. No one else thinks this is a good idea though.\medskip
Exmeh gives a gift of a force field, and fetches Stanri as he tries to follow the lovely ladies away.\medskip
Back to the orcs, after picking up the trail we try and approach from the rear, which as Exmeh rightly points out was always Pilchs favoured terrain. Bernie does some sniffing and suggests\medskip
Exmerah and Myron have a heart to heart, its super touching, and results in Exmerah breaking down and crying whilst promising not to die.\medskip
We make formation and choose tunnel number 5, and as the light fades out we here the distant sound of drums and chanting\medskip
