\subsection{Episode 28: Pets Win Prizes}
\DndDropCapLine{D}ear diary,\medskip
Today almost everyone was still dead, but some new fuckers arrived by one of Exmehs great inventions. I was especially impressed with how the ship crashed and burnt into MarkOSynne. Any carnt that pretends to be a god is better off dead, for the good of all really.\medskip
Riphard also turned up and was typically stubborn about not taking money off lady Haremxe (Exmerah) but Delilah was happy with the pay off, and I guess as they are getting married now it will all work out in the end.\medskip
I must remember to pick up the parts of Gary, if he is coming back in a few years then it should be somewhere nicer. I could always give him to the police department, but at least for a short while he can on the shelf with the bits of Otario.\medskip
Now we must contend with the strange monkey man, somehow Mark is still here. He seems to be abusing the monkey, until in a blaze of light and glory the monkey glows down to his arms. Where there is now a horrid mark, by the lifes of DeRulo wtf is with this shit.\medskip
The new Arbiter has been pissing in the corner of the room for a while, smoking though so maybe he would be interested in some of the magic leaves!\medskip
Exmeh seems to like the monkey though, and has named it Jeremy maybe with a bit of training he could be useful. Come to think of it I’m not entirely convinced the monkey is real, group hallucinations would be a new thing, but recently its got pretty hairy anyway.\medskip
Jeremy may be blind, as he uses his tail stick to tap out his way down a corridor, I am getting more and more convinced he isn’t a real thing. He promptly speeds right out of sight, faster than a horse on kola, probably something to do with the boulder falling towards him. We could probably get a new monkeh, but Exmeh is right the next one might not talk.\medskip
Don’t knwo what the monkeh has been upto but their is parts of tikki tuck everywhere by the time we get there. The guy on the throne seemed unphased by it all, but Jeremy is on it and beats the bejesus out of the two tikki tucks taking him on, both of whom seem to have forgotten their axes. This clearly angers the big boss who hasn’t baked cookies so probably isnt on for a lovely time. Monkeh is in serious danger, as the big guy gets really into it. Too late, all monkehs go to heaven.\medskip
The big guys tries to take Exmeh and I at the same time. Mistakes have been made by all of us, as we get totally boned by the tikki tucks. I should have realised earlier when we found them here, clearly a civilisation that can span the entire world isn’t to be trifled with so lightly!\medskip
Shit looks bad, but the church people are all getting ontop of each other. I smash some kola into the monkehs nose, and hope for the best. The Monkeh seems good for it. Delilah swings in all happy about the wedding and the man pile in front of her, smashing the shit out of the bosstuck. The CBA adds up tho, and Exmerah blows the guys bloody brains out, for years she has been explaining these sums to me, and I finally see why! Myron saves the monkey with his beef jerky and we are good to go.\medskip
For real shit is too much for us.\medskip
We release the imaginary women and liberate the gold from teh back chamber. We also get a lovely belt and a phallic object.\medskip
Exmeh gives the mascot monkey a collar, which grants him resistance to nonn magical attacks twice per short rest. He is best pet, almost.\medskip
Traps traps traps, are they in our mind or did the monkey put them up? Somethings we will never know….\medskip
Oh no it seems like the traps are really dangerous, someone has let out hundreds of butterflies making the blades of swinging death all the harder to avoid.\medskip
I retrieve the gauntlets and massive gem, and despite Exmehs best efforts manage to pay off the hired help. The help also claims the gauntlets, before we go to retrieve the crate of the airship.\medskip
To help us we go and find Trevor the triceratops who trumples us back all the way to the camp!\medskip
