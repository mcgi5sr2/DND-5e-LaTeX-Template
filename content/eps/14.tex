\subsection{Episode 14: Lemon Stealing Whore}
\DndDropCapLine{G}The group have noticed animosity towards the few small folk and ourselves in the village of Logarsk, despite rescuing future children for torture and death and shit.\medskip
Pilch and Riphard agree to organise a bake sale in remembrance of the tragedy of Logarsk and to improve the status of small people in the village for the SRA. They will convince the bereaved mothers to bake cupcakes and sell them at full price, because small cakes are worth just as much as full size cakes.\medskip
Kolo agrees with Hestor to part ways outside Seven Spires due to the danger posed to our group. He then goes to get wood for something. Riphard smells out the most cakely scented house in the village. Pilch knocks on the door and chats with a snooty french sounding man. He agrees that the plan sounds good in the wake of the tragedy and says he will help cook miniature cakes and pies. However, he only has full sized cake tins, so he needs us to get miniature cake trays and tins in addition to any supplies like flour and eggs. His name is Alfonzey Closenough.\medskip
Pilch goes to the farm and meets a large buxom lady. She has a gruff voice. She agrees with the bake sale idea, but asks what she gets in return. Pilch freezes as he searches for an idea. He tentatively flirts with the lady and agrees to come back later to give her something in reward. Cough.\medskip
Riphard heads toward the lemon orchard. Delilah meets Rip on the way and says she can help get the lemons. Rip thinks she’s talking about selling her body, but she tells him how good at stealing she is.\medskip
An old man looks longingly at his lemon trees, with his arm around a beautiful (6/10) young woman. She’s no Delilah. Riphard waits for them to look away for at least 10 seconds. The couple talk about how they love their lemon tree and hope no bandits steal their lemons. They look at their house for no apparent reason.\medskip
Riphard tells Delilah its time to steal the lemons. They head to the tree with their backpacks open, ready to put the lemons in.\medskip
They start stealing the lemons. They’re not spotted. They keep stealing lemons. Still unnoticed, but Delilah suggests they hide behind the tree and get the lemons on the other side. They’ve got all the lemons except one particularly beautiful looking lemon that only Delilah can reach. She fucking nails her reach for the lemon and plucks it perfectly. Unfortunately Rip falls off the ladder, crashing to the ground, alerting the couple.\medskip
“They’re stealing our lemons!”\medskip
“CHEESE IT!” shouts Rip. Rip and Delilah set off running, slowed down by all the lemons, but the couple can’t keep up and they escape with the lemons.\medskip
“Those bloody lemon stealing bandits!” Pilch visits Esme to ask if she can make miniature cake pans. She says she can after some insulting the “fishy wanker”. Pilch asks how long it will take, and Esme presents him with a pre-made miniature cake pan, because she overheard him talking to the frenchy. Pilch seems touched.\medskip
Rip, Delilah, and Pilch arrive back at the baker’s house. He expresses surprise at the sight of the return, thinking they would fail. They discuss the bakesale. Gary shows up talking about children. Alfonzey suggests they sell the cakes at the market, the lemon stall in particular is impressive, who will surely help.\medskip
Somehow a philosophical conversation about life breaks out and Gary drops some deep wisdom, lost on the rest of the group. The group try to sell Alfonzey on the exposure he will gain from taking part as he inquires about fee for the first fucking time. Who agrees to help THEN asks for a fee? Frenchcunt.\medskip
Pilch gives him a gold coin. Which is way over the amount he would charge for a days work. What an idiot. Alfonzey gladly takes the overpayment.\medskip
Riphard suggests they have a look at other stall options. Pilch agrees, saying that the lemon people have clearly helped enough already with their generous donation of lemons.\medskip
The group approach the market. Pilch says him and Esme can knock up some promo materials by the next day to raise awareness for the bake sale. Riphard speculates that there will be a decent amount of foot traffic to the market anyway due to the lack of advanced refridgeration, but that promo materials would help direct people to the stall.\medskip
It turns out the local bakery is totally shit by the way, and owned by Alfonzey’s brother, Alfonzbe.\medskip
Gary and Kolo try to get to speed with the lemon bake sale, who threaten to derail the bake sale by warning the lemon people that their geneous gift of all the lemons could give the village scurvy later on due to the lemon shortage.\medskip
Kolo and Gary go to try and get a stall. They meet Mr Screw, a goblin who makes screws, but is deathly afraid of nails. They tell him of the backsale plan and how it will improve the village attitudes towards small people. It has now become clear that they plan to make their own stall. Mr Screw states that there are 28 screws missing from the market, that he totally didn’t steal back to resell. He has 28 screws for sale.\medskip
For 15 fucking gold! Jesus screws are expensive in this town.\medskip
“There’s a reason they call me The Screwer”\medskip
Kolo tries to steal the screws. Mr Screw goes to offer a discount, but Kolo interupts and offers him a straight swap of 28 new screws he has for Mr Screws 28 old screws he has. Cos that makes sense. Gary compliments Mr Screw at the fine work he does.\medskip
The group look for some wood. Pilch wants to cut down the harvested lemon trees. Because they are clearly now useless. The group scoffs at him.\medskip
Esme has apparently finished a stall and been telling us for a while. She seems upset that no one appreciates her handiwork in the background. Kolo says something creepy and weird. Esme wishes she had a sister. Gary says he can make it happen.\medskip
Kolo suggests Stanri the bear can help attrach people to the bake sale. Esme says he will do a shit job. Stanri is apparently still leaking liquid that Esme didn’t put him in. The group sniff a potential profit in the making, selling seemingly oil from a mechabear. But it turns out it’s just dirty water.\medskip
“Don’t question my work. Fishy wanker.”\medskip
Alfonzey approaches with the lemon goods. He says he used all the ingredients but had lemons left, so made lemonade. Riphard asks if it’s miniature lemonade. The group now need to find small glasses. More work. Riphard is surprised at how quickly Alfonzey made all the cakes, in like an hour, but apparently there’s an incredible arrangement of cakes and pies. A true party of lemon based baked goods.\medskip
The group start the search for small glasses or cups. Except they don’t because everyone is sick of fetch quests.\medskip
Pilch wonders if Gary can guard the produce, but Riphard wonders if Gary eats, and worries he might eat all the pies. Pilch encourages Gary to try a bit of biscuit. Gary Baldy joke.\medskip
Gary likes the biscuit. “EATING IS GOOD!”\medskip
Pilch hooks Gary on cigarettes and breathing. He now has an oxygen addiction.\medskip
THE NEXT DAY\medskip
No one notices anything during the night. Gary ate a load of pies. Fucks sake. He is sleeping under the stalls. Riphard threatens to sell Gary in the bake sale.\medskip
Pilch’s new squeeze approaches. She seductively eats a pie whole and flicks a silver piece in Pilch’s direction. She tells Pilch how much she’s looking forward to tonight.\medskip
No one made the promo material. Esme delivers a letter via Kolo saying “Call your fucking bird off”\medskip
Gary preaches about his new found love of eating to the market goers. Riphard distantly adds in the price, reason for the bake sale, and how it represents that small things are just as valuable in society as full size things. Crowds gather around the stall. “Wow. Food! You gotta eat it!”\medskip
Riphard gives his best salesman pitch, fully utilising the recent child tragedy to exploit the people to donate as much as possible. Kolo spies the lemon people who are dismantling their stall, putting up a sign saying “No Lemons”. Kolo tries to convince them to sell their screws to Screwy, assuming that they no longer need their stall ever again.\medskip
The group still don’t know that lemons grow back.\medskip
Gary thanks the lemon people for their generous gift of lemons. They tearfully explain that someone stole their lemons and that there are no other lemon farmers.\medskip
Pilch tries to convince the others something about limes. But they don’t what limes are.\medskip
They ask Riphard where he got the lemons. Deducing that clearly someone stole the lemons, then posed as a fake lemon salesman. Riphard states that a passing lemon salesman generously gave him the lemons for the good cause.\medskip
The lemon farmers acuse a dwarf and a woman of stealing the lemons. Gary speculates that maybe their prejudice against small people has made them assume it was a dwarf, rather than a normal sized person far away. They say that means the woman must have been a giant. The group agree that that’s an qually likely probability, and go to investigate the crime scene as Riphard continues selling the cakes.\medskip
Apparently this is exactly like the justice league according to Stephen.\medskip
The lemon trees look bare.\medskip
“Oh no, they’ll never have lemons again. They never grow back” says Gary.\medskip
An argument about how lemon trees work breaks out between Gary and the farmers.\medskip
Kolo and Gary invetigate. They find two sets of tracks around the tree. Under one tree is a very accurate imprint of a dwarf arse in the grass. Kolo tracks the grass trail. They go behind a tree and made some mysterious imprints before heading towards the caravan. The group realise Hestor must be responsible.\medskip
“But he’s neither a woman or a dwarf?” - Kolo\medskip
“As far as we know…” - Gary\medskip
They question Hestor about the lemon thieves. Gary intimidates Hestor into sqweelin’ about the thieves. Hestor don’t know nuffin’.\medskip
“Help me help you” says Kolo clichély.\medskip
Hestor says it might be “your friends”. Gary and Kolo come to the reluctant realisation it must have been Delilah and Riphard.\medskip
Hestor wants some of the lemon goods.\medskip
“We have to burn what we don’t sell. Don’t want to demarket the value” - Gary.\medskip
Hestor begs for cakes. They head back to the market. Pilch is just laying there chilling with Quoth, completely oblivious. Riphard, Delilah, the cakes, and the money are gone.\medskip
Gary sweeps all the produce off a neighbouring stall, angry.\medskip
“I’ve had it with this!”\medskip
“THEY CAN’T KEEP GETTING AWAY WITH IT!”\medskip
“We’ve been played for fools!”\medskip
Gary to Pilch: “You’re too close to the ground, you can’t see what matters.”\medskip
The invetigation continues. Gary notices a dwarf shapes hole in the fence behind the stall. They aim to follow the scent of lemons, but they end up in a field of corn. They wander around the field of corn for 30 minutes, lost, accidentally making weird geometric shapes in the corn.\medskip
Gary eats corn.\medskip
“When I sent my mind on a perp, there’s nothing that’s gonna get in my way…. except CORN!”\medskip
They agree to head back to the caravan. They find Riphard and Delilah there, who tell them to hurry up, wondering where they’ve been, oblivious to the invetigation.\medskip
Gary tackle Riphard to the ground, accusing him of stealing the lemons. Riphard says this is libellous and threatens him with legal action. Gary backs off.\medskip
Riphard denies everything, sensibly explaining how everyone has benefitted and is happy and we should just leave. They say they need to compare his ass to the assprint, attempting to carry him off.\medskip
Riphard acuses Kolo of abandoning the SRA and its ethics. It’s pretty tense. Kolo walks away in disgust.\medskip
There’s some more discussion of screws.\medskip
Hestor tells everyone it’s time to leave for Seven Spire. The caravan sets off north. Riphard convinces the group that he’s done good for the village, donating all the profits and totally not stealing the lemons. Kolo remains unconvinced.\medskip
Gary is now a pirate.\medskip
3 days pass as the group travel north.\medskip
The caravan arrives outside Seven Spire.\medskip
It’s a moderate sized city. Hope’s Rest is definitely bigger, but the city is dominated by a fucking huge spire. Hope’s Rest doesn’t have that now, does it!\medskip
The church are in the spire or something, and the district around it is also all dedicated to religion, like tat shops hawking religiosity, which is a real word. Making money and profit is a bit vulgar and is therefore kept to the outskirts, which allows us to get supplies without much risk of church shit going down.\medskip
There are numerous heavy plated guards present. They have sometimes one, sometimes multiple god symbols on them. There’s a right mix of gods being repped. But the guards definitely love that church symbology, which is also a word.\medskip
Pilch and Riphard know that there are certain colourations that represent certain gods and combinations, and they notice it everywhere, informing the fasion of the city. Everyone, particularly the moneyed looking, are sporting serious god swag. Commoners are obviously in potato sacks, as they should be according to the church. Despite this it’s overall quite an ostentacious place.\medskip
Gary gets a small feel and a faint whiff of church corruption somehow in the air or something. He’s not impressed.\medskip
Hestor guides us to friendly and useful merchants.\medskip
Rich pissed off - Steve H doing it now.\medskip
Pilch tracks down the sword - Masudon blade (Masuda area/clan?) - Finds out how to properly sharpen it and how to swing it (slashing, not stabbing) - Might make Kitana +2 attack (+1 damage).\medskip
Kolo goes to buy stuff for travelling across a desert - the exanpanse - northern desert - complete shithole. Spansers are raiders there.\medskip
There’s no port because of shallow waters and rockiness - easy for raiders to get big ships with smaller ones.\medskip
Kolo is upset about everything - he goes drinking. Gary doesn’t need a shield.\medskip
Kolo hates Riphard, Gary, Me, and everything really, even his own sister a bit.\medskip
Gary shits himself after drinking firewater.\medskip
RIP Mikes Fish.
