\subsection{Episode 22: Life and Sole of the Party}
\DndDropCapLine{E}xme mentions about the wolf outside, which Kolo is upset about for some reason.\medskip
She doesn’t know anything about some cult. Exalibrum has too little to go on? The weapon sounds like it’s useful and in Masuda, if we think we can actually find it. The fancy Rubix “puzzle die” in the jungle would also be useful to find the other shit. She asks if she can look into anything. Nothing useful is on our continent. Except maybe the pamphlet, exalibrum, and a poem. Maybe.\medskip
Kolo asks about Voothross. Kiros hasn’t heard of it. It sounds ancient and religious, but got nothing to do with the real gods. Pilch smart arsedly asks if it’s related to Athos. She says no, probably not. Gary knows about Synne. Kiros says he’s super evil. The group umm and ahh over this. She’s surprisingly receptive. She might be a satanist yet.\medskip
She’s in hiding now. The group want to know who the new pastor is in the evil rock village. She says she’ll look into it. Gary wants to be a pastor. Gary doesn’t want to be a pastor. Rocky is a pasta. Kiros is interested in this. Riphard knows he needs to run his businesses.\medskip
Kiros wants to know where we’re going. We don’t know. She encourages our alcoholism. Pilch wants the Rubix “puzzle die”, Exalibrum, to help find the other shit. Kiros say she’s going to find THE METAL. Pilch offers her poetry. GAYYYY.\medskip
Exme raises her hand. There’s talk of dip dongs.\medskip
Exme asks if toads and frogs are boy and girls of the same thing. Like cats and dogs. Kiros says yes, this is correct. Kolo remains quiet on the subject. Gary questions about cats and dogs, which everyone knows are boy and girl animals. Idiot.\medskip
The door is kicked open. An armoured man flanked by 4 guards and 1 orc burst through.\medskip
The group is excited about Zalanthars.\medskip
The main guy has a big fucking gun. Gary says hi. They speak to Kiros. Pilch wants to leave. Kiros says fuck. She stands up and edges out.\medskip
“Arbiter Rickon. Long time, no see.”\medskip
“Oh well, you know me Kiros. Always one to join a party. Especially when I find out my favourite blond haired girl has turned traitor.”\medskip
Pilch thinks he knows the dude. He doesn’t. Gary narrows his eyes and stands with Kiros.\medskip
“I believe you have been misinformed my dear Rickon. I am an upholder of justice and law, no traitor.”\medskip
“Not what I’ve been hearin’ luv.”\medskip
“We are simple shoe advertisers” Exme chimes in.\medskip
“My my, and you’ve got this lot with you too. That’ll seal the deal.”\medskip
Pilch stealths around to the kitchen door to sneak back in to the room he just escaped.\medskip
Kolo eyes up Riphard, who stands up, shouts “CHEESE IT”, and attempts to jump off the table through the window while chucking his fire water into the fire. The window doesn’t break, and Riphard crumples to the floor. The fire water explodes, killing the 4 commoners sat nearby.\medskip
“Ouch!”\medskip
The commoners were Ha, Ree, Samantha, and Charlotte. They were having sex in the city.\medskip
There’s a fight on. The orc dashes straight to Exme and twats her in the face.\medskip
The arbiter with the BFG flips a table for cover.\medskip
Exme shoots at the orc and surprisingly hits. She activates a forcefield. The orc is bleeding badly.\medskip
Kolo marks the orc for killin’, and shoots him with a poison arrow. Totally fucking killerizing him. Kolo teabags the orc corpse.\medskip
Kiros takes cover behind a bench and shoots at one of the redshirt guards, fucking nailing him to the wall behind him. The group’s mouths drop open.\medskip
The redshirts dash to engage a bunch of the group.\medskip
Pilch does nothing useful.\medskip
The bartender is still there, ready to pour pints. Just another Thursday night.\medskip
Riphard takes cover, but his shot pings off the main dudes armor.\medskip
Gary sprints at the main guy to the other side of his table. Exme tries to shoot someone, but doesn't.\medskip
Kolo poison arrows the dudes next to Riphard. One shot. Nice.\medskip
The group seem pretty badass now.\medskip
Kiros misses a different guy.\medskip
The guards further encroach on Rip and Exme and hit them both.\medskip
Pilch makes molotov cocktails from firewater and the barmans sleeve, and throws it at the main dude.\medskip
The group debate the finer points of throwing technique.\medskip
Kolo hits him with the molotov anyway. The arbiter dodges the fuck out of it though, rolling out of the way. Everyone claps. The molotov sets the table on fire.\medskip
Riphard whips out his new scimitars (ironically). He thundertwats the guard into the wall, who explodes. Sweet.\medskip
Gary pushes the table through the fire into the main dude. Gary isn’t wearing shoes. The main dude is so agile. He dodges the flaming table with another tasty combat roll. Gary engages him properly finally, giving him a mean point.\medskip
The guy steps back, giving Gary an attack before certain death. Gary misses.\medskip
“FULL AUTO” He pray and sprays the whole room. The bullets can bend round corners. Ricochet I guess. Most people are badly hurt.\medskip
Exme starts glowing. She shoots at some dude killing him.\medskip
Kolo laughs to himself for the death he’s about to rain down on his human. Over. Confident. To be fair he fucking nails him. He’s still alive though.\medskip
“I ALWAYS HATED YOU RICKON. I ALWAYS KNEW YOU WERE ONE OF THE BAD ONES.” One of Kiros’ shots bounces off, but the other strikes him true. He’s still good though.\medskip
Pilch and his wolf run at the dude, volting the bar. The wolf does not clear the bar and doesnt make it to the dude. Pilch tries to disarm the arbiter. He actually does. Unexpected.\medskip
Quoth is dead. Kolo is happy. Everythings turning up Kolo.\medskip
The group start meta-discussing DnD rules. Everyone is bored.\medskip
Steven wants to aim his disarm into the fire. He’s asking a lot. Mike shuts that shit down. Maybe on a crit. Everyone is happy.\medskip
Riphard doesn’t hit him again.\medskip
Gary shoves the main dude, picking up his gun, and rolls away, pointing the gun at the dudes face. The guy doesn’t hit Gary with his shield.\medskip
“To be honest buddy, I dont know what Im doing with this thing. But I watched you press this button and bullets came out. So how bout you tie yourself up and we have a nice chat instead.”\medskip
He shits his pants. Peaceful(ish) resolution wins the day.\medskip
Gary wants Pilch to strip the guy naked. This is apparently too awkward. AWKWARRRRD.\medskip
Exme wants to know if this is Kiros’ boyfriend.\medskip
“No no, it’s not about the size of their guns.”\medskip
Kolo dissect the orc rapidly into pieces.\medskip
Gary salvages the humans, much to Kolos chagrin. Why must he save these stoopid hooomans. Also charlotte survives. Again kolo is unhappy. Luckily the woman gets her wish to die as Kolo sends an arrow through her. Gary is understandably a bit upset by this. Kolo returns to dissection, and Gary goes off to the interrogation. Meanwhile Pilch has taken Arbiter Rickons trousers off. Rickon is on for a lot of good cop, bad cops. He gets the rough treatment.\medskip
“So lady what’s next?”\medskip
“Rickon was always an asshole”\medskip
Gary tries to convince her of the good within everyone. So she tries to convince Rickon he has gone down the wrong path. He is convinced she is working against the greatest thing to ever exist. The empire of the church.\medskip
“You know nothing Rickon Stark” “I am the light and the bringer, you are the darkness, will you come to me, or will you forever lie in the shadows”\medskip
“He asks for the lowdown?” Gets it and towards the end of the conversation things start to add up for him. He uses the word of truth “Truth Seeker” and Rickon is turned back to the path of light.\medskip
Kolo is disappointed that she has no feelings for him :’(\medskip
Exmeh asks if Crabs are sea spiders and why the do not make webs?\medskip
Gary recalls a time when he was a stone and a spider laid eggs all over him.\medskip
“Insee winsee spider doesn’t lay eggs” He must have been a boy spider.\medskip
Kolo tries again in vane to explain they are different species.\medskip
Rickon is a bit upset about the death of the innocents in the giant spirit drink fire water explosion.\medskip
Gary hands over the rifle to Kyross, for her to do as she fits. He won’t attack us until he finds out more about the truth, in return he gets his rifle.\medskip
Gary states that “All we ever do is delay the inevitable” sending Pilch into an existential fugue.\medskip
Before sending all the wrongdoers to the local police prison for impersonating the church officials.\medskip
Howlov eats the remaining bodies.\medskip
Its agreed we are going around the horn of Africa to explore these new lands in search of the seeking device.
