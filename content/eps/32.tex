\subsection{Episode 32: Difficulty level Spoopy}
\DndDropCapLine{M}onkeh is trying to meditate, there are things that need to be done! He keeps talking about Ki that he needs to recharge, something about the center of the universe. I try and kick him into action. ``Get to work Monkeh''\medskip
Myron clearly the hero, who is on to continue to save the world, “Exmeh seems super interested. The new strat and tat of shoot first talk about it later seems to work well. The skeletons are not attacking us this time. Looting obviously takes place. I get a cape made from bed sheets, and offer another one to Riphard. He goes one further and wears it over his head, looking like a spoooooky ghost. Spooky ghost is our new point man.\medskip
Riphard gives the good old spooky call to what is a fucking ginormous monster!! Exmeh runs off to get the lazy monkeh. Delilah seems to be back into the mix again, thank god she has sorted things out with dwarf chops. Dwarfy malorfy farts and the sheet flies off, blowing his cover entirely.\medskip
Exmeh gives her monkeh a very strong telling off. Running back in time to don a gasmark and be ready for action. The new human tower formation still needs some more work, but it is great to see us working together in new and great ways. We fight the monstrosity in the door way. We make a pile of bodies in the door to keep the monster in place, while that bloody monkeh just sleeps! Myron seems to be using his shotgun to climb and blast the beast to pieces., what a great guy. I must help Exmeh out, he would make a valuable addition to the family. Luckily we survive, and the adventure continues.\medskip
As mother said, we go south, we ransack another apprentices rooms. I pocket as much as possible, including work on the teleportation circle.\medskip
Exmeh goes back and attaches monkeh to Stanri, but the pathetic robot can’t shift him. The stubborn monkey finally moves on. Myron has a good plan of removing the naughty monkehs testicles, should stop the need for us to beat the monkeh so often.\medskip
We keep investigating, although I’m sure Riphard should be in front for the scarem harem tactic to work properly. We are totally bamboozled when the massive doors ahead of us opens to reveal yet another massive monster! This place is full of at least 5 of them.\medskip
Myron gets shot and hooked by the giant beasts fishing rod cross bow thing! We get round to the killing bit a lot sooner than normal, thanks in part to the monkeh actually being there for a change. Bad luck monkeh gets set on fire. Things look grim, as I am impaled at one end of the room by the beasts awful flesh bow. Myron slides under the beast and blows its testes off as the rest of the party come to my aid. Maybe they will come together and be a good team one day. Disgusting monkey steals the beasts flesh bow.\medskip
Stanri starts flashing in sequence, exmeh has to debug the robot. Myron goes to report to the snake people that the monsters are all dead. I write up the pile of unattended bones as a 4031, dammit people should know better than to leave the bones lying around everywhere.\medskip
I run after exmeh as she takes us to the teleport circle, this is bad, I have seen Exmehs experiments blow up before and it is definitely in violation of almost all the codes I know. I hope that Stanri doesn’t takes the entire tower out.\medskip
Myron makes a new friend in the form of a snake that cuddles up to him. Its to be expected he did trade them all the monsters heads.\medskip
We reboot the teleportation circle, in what has to be one of the most painful fashions possible. It zaps me and a ginormous beast back into the circle. Sweet baby jesus she has created a monster! She transfers the brain of old stanri into new STANRI. The thing is just as idiotic as the old one, but hopefully will be a hell of a lot more useful.\medskip
Myron gives us a great inspirational talk, when we ride in on bear. He then goes off for some late night snake action, while monkeh tries to get into the good books STANRI.\medskip
We take a nights rest, and descend into the darkness. The light is much less functional down here, this is gonna make things hard. I seem to be super staticy now, along with a disturbing glow from my eyes that makes it really easy to see my nose.\medskip
Myron seems unchanged as he runs off down a corridor, sometimes he really does remind me of Gary.\medskip
We find sets of skeletons all over the shop down here. I think it is disturbing our monkeh.\medskip
Which was interesting until we see the central garden, with a cube in the middle. The gorgeous garden, that surrounds it is also hemmed in by force fields. The garden must be on the next level down, we must find a way to get to it.\medskip
There is some next level scary shit down here, the group has gone off to activate the right pressure plates. The group has split up to get all the plates but it’s starting to freak with my senses somewhat.\medskip
Myron gets to the second window around the same time the rest of the group returns. Just as I’m about to tell them how they shouldn’t have left him, the dark shape forms behind him. I scream through my mind at him, but to no avail he is far away and possible an idiot. There is nothing else to do but to hurry to his aid, and hope we can arrive in time.\medskip
As I get closer I can see spectral blue shapes with skeletons inside them, the dead are risen. This is as bad as that shit Alatar was into, we need to stop whatever the fuck it is asap. The Monkeh engages with the beast, but before the rest of us can get to it, it swoops through all of us.\medskip
First things first, skeletons must fall, which is proving difficult for everyone. Shit is going on, the skeletons won’t die, and we have heard a blood curdling scream from the other end of the corridor from Riphard.\medskip
The STANRI machine, eats one of the skeletons. While diagnosing Myron with ssssyphhhiliissss. The bear is truly wondrous, and scary. Riphard bounces round the corner and blasts the skeletons too pieces. Nice to see those guns seeing so much action, no wonder the church is so feared across the continent. Haven’t seen the massive cloud beast for a while….\medskip
Vu Dong whips out Pilchs sword from STANRIs back back, and I am furious! How dare he steal Fishys sword! BUT when I see him in action he is like a monkeh possessed, maybe part of Fishy does live on in him… we smash the final skeletons, but as we peer out across the overgrown garden, we see the smoke moonster at the forcefield window again.\medskip
