\subsection{Episode 15: Just Dessert - and some bird people}
\DndDropCapLine{D}ear diary (Exme). We have been having such a busy few days. I had had so much fun at the lemon party that I barely even could remember being there. We had almost two weeks of travel across the sand sea ahead of us and everyone was in high spirits or so I am told. I decided to keep quiet until I had a chance to figure out what was going on. Mother always said “A wise gabrin knows to keep quiet sometimes because sometimes you will look a tit”\medskip

Kolo had the good idea to travel at night. Gary decided to ask around about what was the best thing to do but he must not have gotten any good advice because nothing came of it. I decided to play with my lovely new lion armor. I look like a lion now which is pretty stylish. Kolo told everyone he could navigate by the stars. Last time he tried it I suppose we did get there in the end, but oh so many lives were lost. But you can’t argue with results.\medskip

We headed into the desert. Oh it looked beautiful with all the moonlight spilling over the dunes. Kolo led the way and before we knew it, it was the morning time. On the third night Fishy was acting very strangely. He came out of the caravan all sweaty and black and pulsy and he threw away his sword and said a lot of very naughty words. Kolo and fishy played a little gave of throwy-fetchy but eventually the sword vanished. It is nice to see Kolo helping fishy to feel like he has friends. Maybe he will not feel so sad anymore. I can’t imagine living his life.\medskip

Kolo tells me he tried to get some business advice off Gary about the apothecary. But maybe it sounds like Gary doesn’t quite know what that is. They played a nice game of smacky face to stay awake.\medskip

Another two days passed. Fishy was not looking so good. Perhaps he got some sand in his naughty parts, or at least that is what Kolo has said. It would explain a lot. That and his latent homosexuality. It is a shame he was not born a gabrin. He would have made a bad one and brought shame upon his whole clan, but gabrins are a progressive peoples and would not have judged him so much. Kolo tried to comfort him by trying to get him involved in some botany. Fishy was not so good at it. He just kept running after a little lizard but it kept outsmarting him. Things picked up a little the next day. I was trying to get some sand out of my eyes when suddenly there was a big rumbling! These giant two clacking creatures just came up right of the sand and it was so quick! And they were trying to get the horsies as well! It was not nice at all because the horsies had not even done anything to them except for maybe looking at them a little funny but to be fair they were probably just shocked and it did seem like an over-reaction on the part of the monsters. We had to act quickly to save the horsies and we had to throw everything we could at them. I think it’s safe to say we had the upper sand and those pesky creatures were soon no more. Kolo managed to make the best of the situation and found some liver. Gary doesn’t know if he has a liver so he ate one for some reason. He said he enjoyed it but he did vomit a lot and didn’t look so great. Kolo did some more digging and later he privately told me that he had actually given Gary the creature’s acid sac which of course was not ideal. It is probably best we don’t tell him.\medskip

Kolo tried to tell the horses what was what but they told him in response that that was not what what was. They didn’t seem to want an appled. Gary managed to sneak up to the horses in the way that only a giant rock man can, and healed them up something good. We carried on. Two days and nights later, the desert was making everybody very tired. Kolo kept talking about an apothecary although it was hard to understand him because his mouth was always full of the magic leaves. Probably something to keep an eye on. He keeps singing …... The next day we spotted two camps in the distance. They had caravans and chariots and they were covered in feathers and bees. Kolo managed to see very far, probably because his pupils were so wide, and he saw that the people were not people even but they were actually bird people. They had arms which was odd but we do know a talking rock man so I have come to expect this kind of thing. There were also some humans too in the other camp. I took a moment to appreciate Gary’s hat. I saw delilah give it a jealous look but I didn’t say anything. Gary tried to be friendly. The bird people did not. Gary had to bring in Kolo as an interpreter. He started squawking and it seemed like it might be going okay. Although he was quite twitchy. One of the humans turned up and he was dressed in quite a stupid outfit that kind of looked like a bird but wasn’t. He spoke in a strange voice and had a pipe that he smoked in quite an odd way. Sometimes humans like to try and look interesting like this I have noticed, but the overall effect was someone who had tried too hard to stand out and I felt a little sorry for him. He started spinning some story about his people being savages and the birds being honourable birds and he said that he had invented some kind of games to play to sort it out all out but it was all pretty silly. Somehow Gary got us involved in the games. Personally I felt we had more pressing issues like reclaiming our souls and escaping the untold horrors of the endless burning desert, but it’s always nice to meet new people and try new things so we did it.\medskip

We all had to decide who did what event. Gary was keen on the Melle since he had spent so much time in meleesia. I offered Stanri to do the games with the hope someone might figure out how to destroy him but everyone seems to like him for some reason. His stupid cute face. I have spent the last few nights trying to figure out how to shut him down but something is going on I don’t understand. Sometimes when I look into those glowing optimistic eyes it’s almost like there is something looking back at me…….\medskip

Fishy doesn’t look well. In his obvious weakness he asks us for help. How embarrassing for him. He keeps blithering on about his sword being evil somehow. Kolo steps up and takes the sword. Problem solved apparently. ONLY THE SWORD FLEW BACK INTO FISHY’S HAND. It was funny in a way because Fishy was very sad but maybe it could be a problem. He showed us his new tattoo and he had this look on his face when he did it like it was significant. I tried to look suitably shocked to ease his feelings. He said that it was like the mark of Syn. I got a little bored. Kolo humoured him but quickly everyone else got bored. Kolo tried to teach Stanri a dance. Fishy kept going on so Gary put him to sleep which frankly was a massive relief and was widely accepted by everybody to have been a good move. Everybody picked what they would do. Fishy and gary decided to do melee, kolo and delilah wanted jousting and me and Mr. Riphard decided to do some racing. What an exciting morning. “Manly noises” everywhere in the arena.\medskip

We met the man in the weird bird clothes and he asked about our chariot. This would have been useful information last night but Exme is always ready to step up and sort these messes out. I got to work. Kolo tells me that after I left the melee got underway. It all sounded very excited. Some bird man called KUURAARRRK walked in and at first he looked massive but Kolo was just looking too close. He has a poor understanding of perspective sometimes. They also had FUREKAKKK and short stack and Irana Strongfist which everyone laughed about later but I’m not sure why. It is probably something to do with the patriarchy. Everyone got into position and then the fight beginned! For some reason the crowd was very excited for fish wank and they kept cheering him on. The fight started and kolo says it felt itchy. I thought this was an odd description but I may have misheard because his mouth was full of magic leaves. He said that Gary was beautiful spinning around in a cloud of rainbows and desert-suitable flowery attire. Fishy made everything dark which isn’t great for spectator sports. Kolo says that he wasn’t really surprised, quote “fishy gonna fish”. We have often wondered together how Fishy is still alive. Though I must admit we have warmed to him in the recent weeks, that fact still doesn’t account for his incredible luck in the face of overwhelming incompetence. It is almost endearing in a way that I fear Stanri never will be.\medskip

I was working hard on the chariot. I didn’t have much time but fortunately I’ve considered this scenario many times in the past. I had to steal the wheels and rear axle off one of the caravans and Kolo had to spend quite a bit of time convincing the horses to help. He tells me that he was surprised how racist horses are but I chose not to press the issue. We kept hearing thunderous cheers from the dome. I managed to hook up the shield generator to the frame and sort out some arrangements with the explosives and rockets. Riphard suggested he could use his flatulence in some way to help. I smiled politely as I thought it would be the easiest way to make him go away.\medskip

Hmmm. Kolo is insisting on writing about the fight. He seems very excited about it all, although it is hard to tell through all the magic leaves: (KOLO) Fishy and Gary are in for the big rumble in the dome, classic fishy farts out the darkness and the fight is now behind closed doors. Its very unclear whats going on in general, but looks as if Gary is dancing with the small one. Dark cloud moves just in time, for armoured birdman to skewer the half orc monk. Orcy kebob?\medskip

Garys mystic rainbow stick smacks upside shortstock, a lovely explosion of glitter surrounds them both.Pikey bird pops out of the darkness then stabs shortstock in back, who just lops off the crows head!\medskip

Gary tries to get the crowd riled and behind him, but his heart is not in it, something about birdy beheading has really upset him. The sound of thunder is behind him, and in a unicorn esque sweep of his stick he bats short stock across the ring! Now the crowd love him.\medskip

Darkness drops, and fishy is left flapping on the floor. The crowd goes wild as a the pile of bodies is exposed.\medskip

Gary loses his mind and rushes over healing all the downed warriors. For reasons as yet unexplained the rolling rock gathers no moss. Gary then batters her unconscious, with a mighty glitter bonk, hands out a nap. Instead of dropping out tho she starts a slow Gary chant, whipping the crowd into a frenzy. With the crowd behind him he its nap time for the Tengu, who whips the tengu into a fervour, everyone screaming GARY GARY GARY !\medskip

Until he makes a cry out to the crowd for enjoying the killing. Booooo bitches Boooo, we love the killing!\medskip
