\subsection{Episode 8: Freaky Fishy}
\DndDropCapLine{A}s we join our “heroes”, they have just arrived in the town of Rivers Run or something. It was a long night, so a nice warm burrow was dug for Pilch to enjoy. Pilch lives in a hole in the ground.\\
This town that they’re in is where the church lives.\\
People really want Otoria to stop dying so much and actually help, so they’ve all gone to the shop.\\
They can’t afford any armour, so try to find work to get money. Apparently there’s trouble a’ mine.\\
There’s a bunch of other places to go too.\\
And 4 taverns. Rip gets hard.\\
Sad Crusader, Club and Cask, Open Flask, Minstrels\\
Sanctuary of Novotel - Church place to gain power and money\\
Everyone goes to the Sad Crusader, obvs.\\
It’s great. Everyone has a good time and the service is great.\\
Kolo burns the raven.\\
Pilch drinks terrible beer and Kolo drinks some Killepitsch shit.\\
Kolo buys some of it and some matches. There’s no explanation for this at all.\\
Pilch goes wrong somehow and starts rolling around in his own vomit.\\
Everyone decides it’s probably for the best if they put him down, which is sad, but unavoidable.\\
Then Pilch shits magical darkness and Kolo sets fire to the pub in response.\\
Everything goes to shit and people are running through walls and shit.\\
Outside, everyone realises Pilch is possessed or something and start taking him to the river to drown.\\
Otoria realises there’s two old men trapped inside and runs back in to save them. It’s awesome and she picks them both up and bursts out through the wall of the burning pub.\\
She then returns to the rest and helps them throw Pilch in a river. Kolo’s been rolling him, which is cool but not that efficient.\\
Pilch immediately starts drowning. Everyone’s “really upset”.\\
Pilch wakes up and gets out, then he and Kolo mud wrestle for a bit.\\
The fire’s really getting going now, most of the crew help out, Riphard runs off to another pub, Munchkins, the suave place.\\
He doesn’t get let in, because he’s not cool enough, but then he does the classic Inspector Routine, and totally bosses it.\\
He’s in.\\
Everyone else is saving lives and property from that fire they started, but whatever Riphard, you do your own thing.\\
Munchkins is like that cool jazz bar in Spiderman 3.\\
This whole sequence is basically just Riphard’s methdream. Everyone keeps giving him compliments, booze and boobs.\\
Meanwhile, at the disaster zone, the brave volunteers have sated the fire.\\
Otoria gives the man some money for rebuilding the pub and Kolo asks him to come with them on the adventure. He declines, but gives Kolo the recipe for the Killepitsch stuff.\\
Otoria and Kolo take Pilch off towards the Spire of Emoticon/Immodium, apparently Kolo knows some secret Gabrin magic to fix Pilch which seems to involve leaving him in a hole in the ground and leaving.\\
Riphard is 13 shots down. The remaining 7 shots get put in 2 cocktails for the road, and he crawls off to the central church place to report in with what he found from drinking all of this bullshit. It takes him hours.\\
He’s greeted by two guards, he tries to make them drink the remaining cocktails, and then forgets he’s not a female arbiter. Somehow he gets let inside.\\
He’s going to meet the guy who’s supposed to give him all the money. Everyone’s being nice to him, despite the fact he’s a fucking mess.\\
Riphard meets the guy. Gendry goes and gets the money.\\
Riphard tries to hold a conversation. It goes as well as you’d expect.\\
The guy makes him undrunk. He gets nuzzled.\\
Riphard puts his hand on a ball and it tells him his destiny. His destiny is to be an Alligator.\\
The guy tells Riphard to go and pray at some artifact at the Spire, which is run by the guy’s daughter.\\
Gendry does some top-shelf slapstick with a big sack of money.\\
Riphard takes his comical bag of money into town and looks for somewhere to hide it. He goes to an old man’s shit brick house.\\
The old man thinks Riphard is here to put him down. He’s mildly upset about this, but seems to think his daughter would approve.\\
He’s so old.\\
SO OLD.\\
SO LONELY AND SAD.\\
His daughter wants him to die, because she lives in a wooden house.\\
Rip goes off to find a hiding place for his huge bag of gold. I think he’s going to kill this sad old man.\\
He tells the old man that the gods want to run a shop in his house. The man loves this idea.\\
The old man decides to leave his house to the church when he dies. Riphard is definitely going to kill him now.\\
The old man’s name is Derek Bobacious.\\
Riphard goes off the get himself written into Derek’s will. Hero.\\
Kolo and Otoria are digging a hole in the woods. Otoria finds out that Kolo’s planning the kill Pilch before they bury him, and she doesn’t like this. She convinces him to take him to the Spire instead and they ride off.\\
Back in town, Riphard’s got the contracts drawn up, meets Delilah. He decides to take her to meet Derek.\\
Derek gets the will and sexually harasses Delilah.\\
Derek boasts about his old man dick.\\
Riphard opens a bank in Derek’s house. He calls it Northern Rock, because it sounds sturdy and dependable.\\
Derek reveals that his actual old man dick is broken, but the old man dick in his mind is doing just fine.\\
Riphard sets everything up and rides off to meet the others.\\
They arrive at the Spire.\\
They meet Holly. She lets them in.\\
There’s a party going on, but they’re not invited, especially the definitely naturally ill guy they’re here to find a cure for.\\
Riphard presses Holly for info about the vaults and shit.\\
He tries to get investment into a colab on this banking startup he’s planning.\\
Holly tells them where all the books they want are, and also that only Pilch can read the ones on possession and Devil shit, which why would they even need that, because he’s just got food poisoning or something.\\
Riphard finds a book about the thing he’s looking for. Otoria finds a book about syphilis. Kolo finds a book about possession and what to do about it.\\
We need to get a pastor to do a thing and then purge him.\\
If this doesn’t work, we’ll just kill him.\\
We’re gonna fix fishy,\\
Riphard is chanting, Kolo feeds Pilch half a bottle of Killepitsch.\\
Vomit.\\
Vomit. Vomit. Vomit.\\
VOMIT.\\
VOMIIIIT.\\
VVV OOO MMM III TTT\\
It seems moderately successful. Fishy lives.\\
He gets a shadow sword, and stops being so obviously possessed.\\
Pilch agrees to stay at least 15 feet from Otoria at all times he's not actively saving her life, on pain of sword.\\
Everyone goes to a party.\\
There’s all sorts of people at the party, including people from the same continent as Otoria, which is rare.\\
Otoria introduces everyone to a plant expert, and goes off to get drinks.\\
Holly turns back up, and offers to show Riphard the artefact he’s here to see. The others can come too.\\
Pilch puts a sword in his ear.\\
Rip, Kolo and Esme go to see the thing.\\
Pilch goes to be sick in a hole.\\
No one realises that the last time they saw Otoria, she was off getting them drinks.\\
Everyone else is in the vaults, having a lovely time all together.\\
They go and see the thing. It’s a ruby sphere 2 fists wide.\\
Mike loves getting fisted.\\
Riphard meditates into the stone. He realises he loves the church loads.\\
Suddenly, off in the distance, some people hear a scream, most people do not.\\
