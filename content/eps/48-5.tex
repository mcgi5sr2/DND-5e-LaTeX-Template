\section{Episode 48.5: Josie and the Hellcats}

\medskip

\DndDropCapLine{H}ell – a lovely afternoon with an orange glow. Devils are wandering about in a nice part of town. A young Tiefling woman is lying in bed asleep. She turns over and sees the alarm clock seeing that it’s blue past omega and she realises she is late for her first business meeting. She sounds a lot like a young girl called Gabigail She’s going to a Hell training assessment day. She comes to a clean conference room with a stern looking woman by a clipboard. Not-Garbigail apologises for being late. It turns out her name is Josie. Mark, Lazarus and an old man are all here as well. After some initial banter we are introduced to a bicentennial management training day. \medskip

There is an agenda:\medskip

Introductions Lynne Shephard is running it – she has taken over from Margaret after “the incident”. She is an adulteress who catfished men and killed them.\medskip

Mark O’Synne – He was stuck in a book but now he’s back. His fun fact is that he likes big thick women and long walks on the beach.\medskip

Lazarus – Head of bringing people in.\medskip

Josie – Intern programme for exceptionally evil people. She is a really bad sort. Fun fact – once accidentally murdered herself/mother/sister who is Garbigail\medskip

Ron – head of marketing and development. Very good at his job. Even though he doesn’t have to do anything.\medskip

There is no fire drill so if the alarms go off then hell has frozen over and the end times are here Mark’s example of evil is papercutting someone as a book Josie killed seven cats by putting them in a box and leaving them. She killed an old man. Nobody is very convinced but only the evillest people get in on the evil internship. \medskip

The icebreaker – Lynne beckons Meredith in who wheels in a big block of ice to the room. Lynne asks who wants to break the ice and after some back and forth Josie is volunteered. She levitates a hammer and fails to chip the ice but it does nothing. Laz tells her to keep going and tries to secretly blow it up. HE succeeds, but is not very stealthy. WE move on to the task: Timothy Wainwright – an exceptionally good man who ran a charity helping kiddies. In his late life he lost so many children he developed a gambling problem. We have 30 minutes to use the tools on the table to develop a plan to inflict the most pain and horror Items: A ball of yellow wool Ping pong paddles Half bottle mayo Pen and paper Pack of cards Tikki tukk mask. \medskip

We start trying to come up with stuff. Ron wants to lacerate his anus with mayo. Josie comes up with terrible ideas. Ron comes up with awful violent ideas. Josie comes up with more awful ideas. Lazarus puts forward an idea about using cards to get him to gamble for not being tortured, but everything loses so he gets tortured. Mark tries to put forward an idea but wants to act it out, he puts some “fun bucks” on the table and walks around. Ron tries to push him out of the window but Mark is too fast and lucky. Meredith smacks him with his trunk but luck bends and she falls on top of Mark with her big elephant boobs. Josie raises a hand and asks to leave to go to the toilet, Ron wants to follow so Josie lets him go first then she goes. Ron comes back invisible to shirk his work. Mark and Laz come up with a terrible last minute plan as the clock comes down. They get into the torture time – Lazarus decides that the best torture is a slow, mental torture and invites Timothy to be part of the management committee. Josie does not take this very well and there were arguments. Ron sticks a pen into his head. Josie tries to one up him by smashing mayo into his head and pulling his eyes out. As he starts to bind back together Lazarus paints an image of children suffering and dying on the inside of the tikki tukk mask and pins it on his head which tortures him. Mark makes it actually work by bending luck. There is a debriefing where everyone gets told they are not shit at their jobs. Lazarus feels it is a bit of a lie. Ron created Disney to torture kids.\medskip

We have light refreshments and go on an adventure. We arrive the Maze of Infinite Horrors. We have to reach the centre to get a fabulous prize. Mark and Laz are a team, we go first and head in. We work our way around. Josie and Ron bicker and start to go. They come across a vortex pit filled with billions of swirling, bleeding arms. Ron makes friends by giving out business cards, he high fives them and attempts to crowd surf across the pit. He steps into the pit and feels the immensity of the atmosphere drop to nothingness, the arms pull at him. Josie looks up what she should do in the employee handbook and lets Ron fall. Ron uses his charm and wile. But he fails because he is mediocre. Josie helps by blasting him with fire and fury as he gets dragged down by a thousand arms. Ron takes a lot of damage and disappears into the ether.\medskip

Mark and Laz turn a corner and are right into a dragon. They try to fight the dragon. Mark nearly dies. Laz’s attacks don’t do much so he picks the dragon up and throws it to mark before carrying on. Josie walks past the pit which no longer exists and finds a rainbow dragon that is all the dark colours of the rainbow. She gets immediately hit by the rainbow dragon as she can barely look at it. Josie tries to give the rainbow dragon a lecture. Ron gets burped out of an infinity sphere and lands on the ground back at the start. Josie sidles past the dragon. Mark is under a dragon. He tries to talk him out of killing him but gets eaten, exploding in a golden shower and reforming at the start. Lazarus continues and finds an imaginary D20 which is his friend. He takes advice from the dice on directions.\medskip

Ron tries to cut through a bush to get back but cannot, so says he needs to find his Tiefling partner to “giver her a fingering”. Ron tries to catch up and knows the Rainbow Dragon, she says he would make her a star. Ron fingers the dragon up the arse. Again. He threatens the dragon and moves the fingers to a fist. As the dragon fails to bite him, he slides his fist further up. “You’re just gonna be another one of my puppets love”. Mark goes into an obvious dead end and tries to teleport to the centre. Unauthorised use of powers creates a centaur. Which smooshes him with a hoof. Lynne gives him a big cross on a sheet. Ron tries to persuade the dragon to take him, but his fist is in her, so it fails and the dragon drags him off.\medskip

Lazarus finds the Riddlenoscerai and enters a game of riddles. He passes the first riddle and asks about the riddlenoscerai’s friends. We have a flash of backstory full of other riddlenoscerai being murdered. Ron gets dragged by the dragon and finds a pocket watch on the floor. He is still stuck in the dragon. The watch spins super fast and ages him 20k years. He plunges the watch into the ground to try and age the earth to get closer to retirement. He for some reason picks it back up to shove into the dragon but cannot and ages into dust. He reforms out of the dust in the start again as a baby and ages again. Ron orders a UPS? Van and crafts something in the back of the van before driving into towards the maze and getting stuck in the maze wall.\medskip

Mark tries to deceive the dragon with telepathy. And uses his luck to make the dragon move away so he can sneak by. Ron’s UPS? Van has a shrinking device and transforms into a low rise. Four guys fix the UPS van into a lower mode. The UPS? Van drifts around the maze corner and Tokyo drifts around. Mark finds a golden chalice and drinks it – two ghosts come out and ask him if he’s worthy. Mark refuses to answer. Mark O’Synne says he isn’t worthy and the ghosts enter his body. The gate opens and lets him through. Ron create a Pteordactyl, nobody is sure why. Lazarus beats the Riddlenoscerus and sees Josie trying to sneak up behind him. Laz asks her to join him as his teammate is gone. Lazarus and Josie have a chat as they come to a dead end. Laz believes Josie isn’t really evil and she confides in him that she isn’t and there has been a clerical error. Laz says its good to have someone who isn’t a massive arsehole. Laz gets trapped inside a mirror world after getting sucked into a mirror. He tries to escape but can’t so shifts reality to break his way out.\medskip

Mark sneaks around, Ron escapes from a box and arrives at the Riddlenosceri. Mark appears at the same time and then starts vomiting ghosts before dying. He resurrects again and realises he is not Worthy. Ron puts gems in the riddleosaurus’ eyes. It does nothing. Laz and Josie continue towards the centre. Laz gets betrayed by his friend D20 who stabs him in the back. Laz disintegrates it…then there’s a creepy little girl. She begs for help and moves to Laz. Laz tries to get past her but she wants help and is very insistent so he brings her along. Laz and Josie get to the centre and Laz is betrayed by the little girl, who is D20 in disguise. He gets stabbed in the back again and D20 dissappears. Laz and Josie investigate the chest, which has a gold coin in that grants a single wish. Laz gives the wish to Josie as long as she uses it on something he agrees with. She attempts to wish for herself into power and Laz under her but Laz intimidates her into making the wish so Laz is the top dog. They all go back, getting ice cream and then eating a buffet. Ron is fired by Josie but stays to eat buffet food. Laz explains his plan for the future – hell is too populated and many of the people coming to hell don’t really deserve to be there. He will be using a loophole to shunt 5 mortals slightly in time so that when they should die and come to hell they instead come to hell without dying so he can send them back. He asks Josie to run hell while he focuses on this plan. Mark returns to the mortal realm to lend his luck to the mortals. Josie immediately becomes more sinister and Welsh with her new level of power and tries to murder Lynne. Laz sits back in his chair in his new office as everyone leaves, comfortable that hell is in good hands.\medskip
