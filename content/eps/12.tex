\subsection{Episode 12: The Marshal Methias EP}
\DndDropCapLine{T}he Gang start off by talking to Gary about his past.\medskip
He shares a few stories, for example about Jason Derulo, who was sat on by a thing and killed thousands of years ago. Everyone wants to know about The Ancients, but he’s just a rock, so he doesn’t really know much.\medskip
They ride back towards River’s Fall, Gary running alongside the horses.\medskip
They meet a small urchin, with a message from the caravan guys. It’s all “come talk to us, but don’t be seen”. The boy wants to be paid, but is disappointed.\medskip
No one knows how to get into the centre of town without being seen. Kolo asks a dog, who tells him to chill out and then Kolo licks his balls (no the dog’s balls).\medskip
They all decide to “put on disguises”, which means blacking up for everyone but Esme, who is already black. Gary has a black smudge on his face now which apparently isn’t good enough, so the guys make him a cool outfit out of a pretty flowery blanket and some fashion bloomers.\medskip
Now everyone’s completely incognito, the Gabrins go scouting ahead in the classic stealthy trenchcoat ensemble, and the others follow a respectful distance behind.\medskip
Nothing seems weird in the town, so all this stress was over nothing, I guess.\medskip
The Gabrins start talking to Hestor, but forget who isn’t the groin.\medskip
Hestor takes them through the fabric flap door thing into the back of a caravan and tells them that that Annoying Arbiter called something dumb is looking for the group, and that they should be on their guard.\medskip
Hestor tells them that the caravan is going to do them a solid and doing a diversion during the journey to The Seven’s Spire, so that the Arbiter will assume they went to a different place.\medskip
Kolo chats with Fishy’s raven, who turns out to be a stand-up guy. He takes the message back to the others, who have just been hanging out somewhere, probably.\medskip
Fishy suddenly remembers he’s supposed to pick up some armour, but the others can’t be arsed to stealth into the middle of town, just to leave again, so agree to meet outside the town..\medskip
Fishy goes to the armour shop and offends the guy slightly by not sucking his dick hard enough. He gets the armour and leave.\medskip
Esme reutilises a tiny prank bag to put on the back of the raven, potentially to allow drug smuggling.\medskip
The caravan leaves town, seemingly without a hitch. But maybe there was a hitch. Maybe.\medskip
Two weeks pass on the caravan. Gabrins tinker. Rocky businesses. Fishy tries to suck up to (and on) Gary, who doesn’t seem to love how violent he is.\medskip
They get into the town, whatever it’s called.\medskip
Everyone from the town is in the town square being real sad. There’s a young boy and the mother in the centre.\medskip
Apparently, it’s his time to participate in the local coming-of-age ceremony, which seems to have a high fatality rate. After Gary pokes around a bit, they find out that there’s a thing that happens in the church at night during the ceremony.\medskip
They find the local religious leader, who is called Eminem.\medskip
Everyone’s all “don’t try and be insidy, outsiders”.\medskip
The place is called Logarsk.\medskip
Everyone goes to the pub, and agrees that the Gabrins should stake out the church and see what happens.\medskip
Esme is eating a big bear of the local delicacy “Pom-bears”.\medskip
The lady who’s son is going to get ceremonied comes up to ask the group for help.\medskip
Apparently, the children go to the church, and get put on trial to see if they’re evil. If they are, something that sounds like Babayaga (but not quite), comes and takes them away.\medskip
The group carry on drinking, promising the woman they’ll do something.\medskip
Riphard eventually gets drunk enough to suddenly leave the pub and go to the church. The Gabrins follow.\medskip
Wankfish stands outside the pub, just generally chilling.\medskip
Gary is inside the pub, still, staring straight ahead while Delilah tries to flirt.\medskip
Back at the church, Riphard forgets the secret observation plan and knocks on the front door, asking for some church.\medskip
The guy who opens the door is one of the guys they were talking to earlier, so immediately tells Rocky to go away. Somehow, though, potentially by being drunk, Rocky convinces the guy that he needs to pray and has to come in. Riphard’s alcoholism has been pretty beneficial in the long run, really.\medskip
Once he gets in, and loudly proclaims that he can pray anywhere he wants, Eminem shouts at him and tells him to go away.\medskip
Riphard responds that it’s fine because they left the pews out.\medskip
They did not leave the pews out. Rocky gets told to leave.\medskip
He does.\medskip
The Gabrins are on the roof, unable to gain ingress.\medskip
Eventually, they slip in between the roof tiles, and get in, just in time to see Rocky get thrown out.\medskip
They do a bit of watching, then send the raven off to get help. And also Pom-bears. Also, they’re planning to blow up the church, so there’s that.\medskip
Gary and Pilch come to the church, bringing both help and Pom-bears. They pick up Rocky on the way. Literally, because he’s unwilling.\medskip
Fishy tries to open the front door, ignoring the plan, which is not to do that.\medskip
Fishy refuses to follow orders. The Gabrins still have the only plan, which is to blow up the church.\medskip
Wankfish is now a raven, and is fluttering about, still not following the plan.\medskip
He lands on the statue and does the whole “Greetings Mortals” bit.\medskip
One guy buys it, but Eminem hits him in the face. Then he shoots the raven.\medskip
Wankfish is still a dick after that, and tries to kick the doors down.\medskip
The Gabrins suddenly realise the kid could be downstairs and think they should go downstairs. They go and tell the others the plan, and Gary suggests having a chat with the bad guys at the front door to cause a distraction, or, ideally convince them to change their minds.\medskip
The Gabrins meet back on the roof and agree to involve Stanri the robot bear in some way.\medskip
Stanri briefly has a human brain, but then it’s retconned.\medskip
The Gabrins scamper off into the basement to see what’s happening.\medskip
Gary knocks on the door and explains that there’s obviously some mistake, because he thinks they’re bad guys, and they must be good guys, and could he please speak to the boss please and his foot’s in the door, but it’s not a problem because everyone’s nice.\medskip
Meanwhile, Esme sings the traditional Gabrin folk tune “Gabrins on the way, having fun, and save the day.”.\medskip
They find a room downstairs, but it’s empty, but it’s not because there’s a secret door.\medskip
Gary and Wanker get invited in. Rocky tries to climb the church, but fails, and then succeeds.\medskip
Gary and Wanker talk to Eminem, who, wouldn’t you know it, he’s evil.
