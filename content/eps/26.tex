\subsection{Episode 26: Never Walk a Stone}
\DndDropCapLine{T}he camera skims the tops of scattered cloud cover, miles above a dense, dark, forest canopy. Just about visible, brightly coloured tropical birds scatter, scared by something large moving in the trees.\medskip
The camera drops towards the disturbance, and we hear, before we see, a large, four legged reptile with three horns and a large frill is crashing through the undergrowth. On its back, a ragged Howdah sits, containing two Gabrins, a big grey guy, and a little golden guy.\medskip
These, apparently, are our heroes.\medskip
They arrive at the Tikituk Temple, and find a whole village of the fuckers built around it, with Tikiwoman and Tikichildrens all over the place.\medskip
They’re all just hanging out and living life, which is simply unacceptable. Clearly something must be done.\medskip
There’s a pen of dinosaurs over at the edge.\medskip
Kolo decides that Kolo should go and set all the dinosaurs free while other people try and talk to the Tikituks, depsite the fact that he’s the only one that speaks Tikituk. Gary makes himself a small person, and he and Esme put on Tikituk masks.\medskip
Esme can understand Tikituk somehow, but can’t speak it, so she goes up to a Tikiwoman (who can also be referred to as Tittycuks) and explains using pictionary that there’s attackers coming and they should all run away. It goes… medium.\medskip
Gary is riding Terry the Triceratops into the middle of town, looking like a bald, mentally handicapped Tikituk, shouting the words Tiki and Tuk at random. It wouldn’t be too bad, but Mark is also on the Howdah with him, and he hasn’t thought to do anything in particular, so is just a golden, waving man.\medskip
Garytuk realises that Mark is there, and throws him off the dinosaur angrily.\medskip
This starts freaking everyone out and they ring an angry bell that makes Pteranodons come out of the sky. Mark blows them up, and now everyone’s really freaking out.\medskip
Womantuks and Childrentuks run all over the place. Garytuk comes with them, on the back of Terry, joining a big freakout stampede. Esme pictionaries the guy ringing the bell that there’s bad guys coming out of the jungle. This makes him freak out more, not less, for some reason.\medskip
Kolo fails to convince the dinosaurs to emancipate themselves, so drugs them instead.\medskip
Then, for some reason, every starts freaking out at Mark EVEN MORE, and the Tikituks, Tittycuks, Garytuks and Terrys all run off into undergrowth together. Gary tries to help 8 Tikituks into the Howdah, but then falls off, and all his friends disappear into the jungle.\medskip
Meanwhile, in a classic Gabrin 1-2, Kolo shoots the guy who’s ringing the bell, and Esme takes over, slowly coming to a stop.\medskip
Mark blows up some people.\medskip
Now there are 4 Marks of different colours. Lark, Jark, Sark, and Shark, who is the coolest by far.\medskip
Just as everyone assembles on the steps of the Temple, Gary looking sad at the lost of both his friends and his dinosaur, the dinosaur drugs kick in and shit gets wild.\medskip
The gang decide to head inside the pyramid temple thing.\medskip
In a small room just inside the door at the top of the temple, there’s some (relatively) big Tikituks who immediately knock Mark the fuck out and zap Sark out of existance.\medskip
Gary goes in and heros all over the place, standing over Mark, waking him up,throwing him away from harm and using his cool shit to not be hit by the bad boys.\medskip
Kolo’s hiding in a corner, doing a Kolo thing. Esme uses her shield to not be murdered.\medskip
Mark, now not dead, runs back and does a magicky kinda thing.\medskip
Esme goes to get ganked in the corner. For a minute, everyone thinks she’s dead, but then they realise she’s not. Gary is not, for sure.\medskip
Kolo does shit.\medskip
Mark does shit.\medskip
Esme runs out of the corner and murders a guy.\medskip
Gary does hit.\medskip
There’s some general battling. People do shit.\medskip
Gary hits a guy round the head enough that he ties himself up and goes to have a little sit down. He offers the only other guy left alive the manacles, but he’s a jobsworth and thinks it would be better to be killed first.\medskip
Kolo slits the throats of the guys who tried to hurt Esme before Gary can save them. The other guys get sent back down to DinosaurDrugTown where they belong, having failed to protect their temple, and being shown to be generally shit.\medskip
Mark says he thinks this ancient temple is a old religious site. Everyone’s real surprised.\medskip
Esme gets addicted to Koko Kolo, which is sad, because she deserves better in life.\medskip
The gang head downstairs into another room, which is old and used to have a picture of something on it. It’s weird. This place looks like a temple, but the pictures don’t look like the gods, and this place doesn’t feel like religion.\medskip
There’s a lot of blood, though.\medskip
And bones.\medskip
The gang head down a corridor, Gary holding a flaming torch above his head, all sidewise like in films he’s not seen, and with an Esme on his shoulder, which doesn’t happen that often in films, because she has yet to break into the biz.\medskip
There’s a room full of Tikituks and they all die really quick. One of them runs away and is hunted down by Kolo.\medskip
Kolo looks around and sees he’s in a room full of half-eaten human corpses.\medskip
He is so happy.\medskip
Everyone else is in the other room, feeling awkward.\medskip
Eventually, they meet up with him, and then find a staircase down. Being completionists, they decide to finish this floor first.\medskip
Kolo finds a bedroom. There’s a whole load of cute dinosaurs in it, who live here, having fun and playing games. Kolo makes friends. They seem a little bit creepy, but maybe that’s just my unconscious bias against dinosaurs.\medskip
Kolo fails to convince them about emancipation, of course, and so, of course, drugs them instead. Because Kolo, he is gonna Kolo. They all start sneezing and it is the cutest thing in the fucking everything.\medskip
He opens the gate, so that everyone can meet the fun dinosaurs. Obvs, they betray his trust and all try and run out of the gate.\medskip
Kolo just closes the gate again.\medskip
Kolo the Wise outwits the tiny baby dinosaurs. He is so very wise.\medskip
Gary tries to talk some sense into the dinosaurs, but can’t actually talk to them at all. He tries to send them to sleep, but it seems almost like they have some sort of chemical assistance in staying awake, which is strange because Kolo swears he didn’t give them anything.\medskip
Gary, via Kolo manages to convince them to go outside. Mark, after many failures manages the burn down the gate to their pen on the side that the guys aren’t. They go outside.\medskip
Kolo skulks ahead, and finds a room full of those meanies they fought upstairs. They try and lure them out by saying the dinosaurs have escaped. Nothing happens. Gary tells them that they’re here to fuck the temple up, and that doesn’t work either.\medskip
Gary goes into the room, and being Gary, just tells the 3 baddies off for being rude.\medskip
Gary immediately gets full on ganked.\medskip
He is all down all over the place.\medskip
He is all down all over the place all by himself in a room full of fuckheads.\medskip
Kolo the Wise rushes in, and feeds him a load of drugs because he’s the fucking best/worst.\medskip
Gary crawls off down the corridor feeling like a bellend.\medskip
Esme throws dynamite at those fuckers, because that’s what they deserve.\medskip
They don’t die, which feels like cheating.\medskip
Mark does nothing, but ages visibly by 23 years. But, like, not in his age, or anything. He is less shiny. This seems fine.\medskip
He clogs up the corridor with his bodies, of which he currently has 4 again. Shark and Lark die in the onslaught, and its emotional as… fuck?\medskip
Everyone is now doing what they wanted to all along, and is lying in wait as all the baddies come round the corner one by one.\medskip
Gary hides round a corner, Kolo, Exmeh take their marks,\medskip
The first tikki tuk emerges and immediately falls to the Gabrins fire power. The next two Tikki Tucks swing straight into Gary. The stone giants stands his ground as piece by peice parts of him are carved off. The sounds that emerge from him, have not been heard for 1000s of years, and now may never be heard again.\medskip
With what remains of his life force, he stretches his arm away from the Tikki Tuck guards and plants his stick. A rush of energy pulses through the branch, as an arrow and chunk of metal are propelled from his Gabrin comrades into the remaining guards slaying them where they stand. The blood of the fallen Tikki Tucks seeps around the base of the branch as it surges into a full tree. Gary is no more, but a monument to what he stood for remains.\medskip
The Gabrins scream their grief at Mark, and Kolo takes some clippings from the his tree.\medskip
The remaining members of the party return to the top of the temple, to watch without glee the dinosaurs reek havoc among the Tikki Tucks below. The day is sad, and even Kolo doesn’t take joy from the scenes playing out below them.\medskip
Memories after this point are hazy.\medskip
