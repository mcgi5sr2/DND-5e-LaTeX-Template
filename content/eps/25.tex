\subsection{Episode 25: Terrible Trebuchets and Tenatious Tiki-tuks}
\DndDropCapLine{H}Hi There!\medskip
I’m Mark, Mark O’ Synne.\medskip
I’m going to write some of what happens in this here jungle. Let’s see what happens!\medskip
So I’m travelling with two short green goblins, and some rock-man that’s stinking of the gods divine might. I like him. He thinks he’s my pop. It’s weird.\medskip
I mean, I know who they are, I might have been on Pilch’s forearms but I did share some brain-space with him. And thank the gods he wiped with his right.\medskip
We travel about east about two days. Days are weird things. Not really seen many of them.\medskip
We come to a big river. I don’t seem to be able to cross it, which is sad.\medskip
The goblins have built an awesome ride. I’m going to try it out!\medskip
….I’m back, I was telling Lucy that like, this was a crazy idea, but so much fun. I saw a few sites o’ interest while I was up in the air.\medskip
The other seem a bit weirded out that I just reappeared like that, must not be a mortal thing.\medskip
We find an oasis, lucy paddles with me. It’s lovely. The male Goblin gives me a bit of something something, it helps me sleep. I’m on an adventure. I wake up. I’m still on an adventure, but now I’m big gary’s hat.\medskip
Monkeys attack. Exme has bad luck, but not anymore! It dies in spectacular fashion.\medskip
We head back into the jungle, and eventually find tribes people!\medskip
They’re super nice, they give us a pipe, but Lucy doesn’t like it.\medskip
Kolo translates.\medskip
Few things to note…\medskip
The big-ass gorillas that attacked us are considered “Small”.\medskip
There’s a tribe of weird “dildo”s the the east that causes problem for the people.. Dildo might be Kolo’s translation.\medskip
There’s “ancient ones” - giant mofo’s that roam the jungle. Do not mess.\medskip
We’re going to kill some small people to help the big people. Small people are cannibals.\medskip
Kolo put something tasty in my pipe, probably. Mmmm….\medskip
Sleep.\medskip
Sleep is weird, yeah? I’m new to it, but it’s pretty fun.\medskip
I awaken, we’re going to bed.\medskip
The next day the chief gives us Kevin Sorbo - a valiant scout/warrior/hercules of the tribe. He’s going to guide us to the enemies.\medskip
Oh shit, the enemies are tiki-tuks. On a triceratops.\medskip
We kill the tiki’s, Exme scatters brains everywhere. We manage to make a new ally in Triceratops.\medskip
He’s called Terry.\medskip
He’s got Stockholm syndrome.\medskip
Stockholm is a terrible place.\medskip
Writing is tiring.\medskip

Mark sits on Gary’s shoulder, while Gary sits in the Pagoda of Terry. Terry happily munches an apple. Exme tinkers in the back, looking to be putting together some kind of jug - having constructed a portable kiln out of palm leaves - there’s discarded notes of “folding boat” around her. Kolo looks out, all around, his eagle eyes catching all the strange fauna as it walks past.\medskip

Lucy stretches her three tentacles and then makes her shrills screaming noise, smacking one of her beaked maws in anticipation. Classic Lucy.\medskip

Mark likes it here, he likes it with these people. The sun sets upon the party. They don’t know where they’re going, but they’re going there in style.\medskip
