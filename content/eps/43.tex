People of note: Rimjay - Dead guard, played by Myron and Exme
The boy - Kolo’s disguised self.
Gojiro - The guard I’m mistaken as
Romjiro - The prince we’re rescuing
Julieto - The Emperor’s daughter - love interest of Romjiro.
Hiroshi Akana - The Emperor
Daisuke - the unconscious translator.

\DndDropCapLine{R}ecap: Last time, we’d come to the fort of a minor noble - nicknamed here the emperor - he’d kidnapped the son of another noble and was holding him randsome - if we rescued the prince (not a prince, son of the other noble) we’d get the assistance of someone in an upcoming battle - plus the opportunity to cause some havoc on the way out - gain an ally and weaken an enemy. The cube had endowed Kolo with flight and he’d reconnoitered the area, while causing some minor havoc - and subsequently we’d managed to ambush and kill some guards, and taken their disguise - with Kolo illusioning himself into a little boy… for some reason.\medskip

We enter the castle grounds convincingly, everyone thinks that we’re the guards, and my accent is ~racist~ flawless. A big dude accosts us and accuses Rimjay of Drinking. I manage to brag it off as him “having lost his brother today” - but we’re probably going to get written up for that. We make it into the castle, planning to “report our findings” - while finding stuff out. We make it up several floors, the guards are highly ineffectual. Rip takes a shit, stinking out the castle. Daisuke (yeah, he's still with us) promptly vomits and passes out, still on Rips shoulders. Me and Kolo go on a tour for the “Lieutenant’s son”, spotting guards. We have a chat and a natter - Romjiro (the prince) has been shagging the emperor’s daughter. Gossip!\medskip

We go upstairs, the emperor shouts at us for interfering, but I manage to convince him to get to the window - the plan is to then jump on the lovebirds, and teleport out! Until Myron Shoots the emperor in the back…. And all hell breaks loose… The emperor stabs the shit out of myron. Various guards attack is ineffectual and die quickly to Kolo, Exme and a combo of Riphard and me. The prince reluctantly joins the fight against us, giving me an indifferent double crit to the chest. We fight it out, I manage to convince the prince to come with us. He manages to convince the daughter to come with us, but she’s conflicted. Fighting ensues, Firebrand and mass slaughter occur, Myron drops a smoke bomb and we all collect to teleport - with the daughter conflicted, but likely to come along. I tell them that we’re the good guys.\medskip

Unfortunately… the cube can only teleport 4 people… 500 feet. Me and the goblins and the prince end up outside - with the rest still fighting at the top of the tower. The goblins run back in, and I follow, deciding I’d rather die with friends. Beta team go! We run back in and I try to convince the guards that goblins have assaulted the town. The goblins promptly ignore this and we start fighting our way back up the tower. We wipe out the first wave of guards, with Romjiro deciding to join the fray.\medskip

Upstairs - Rip promptly surrenders, and then Myron tries to draw the girl into the persisting smoke cloud. He succeeds. Rip then tries to whip him from short range. Thunderous smite! Sends the dude flying… if he had hit and not missed... We run up, slaying guards on the way up… Myron throws Julieto out a window. Yep, that just happened. She splatters dead on the ground outside. Rip finally whips to the face - and promptly gets floored to death saving throws. We’re still making our way up the tower.\medskip

Rip passes all his death saves. We continue up - Myron gets himself ready to suplex the lord out the window. Almost manages to - but doesn’t quite - they start grappling each other Kolo shoots the last Archer - sneak attack baby! Dead. The grapple match continues - Myron is probably going out of a window - BUT THE EMPEROR NAT 1’S IT. Ah, but it’s an ability check, and Myron rolls shit. He fails his dex save, and falls out the window. Splat #2. At least the princess broke the fall. The smoke cloud finally disperses, leaving me and the goblins (and an unconcious RIP) on the top floor with a very pissed off and recently bereaved Hiroshi Akana.\medskip
