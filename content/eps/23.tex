\subsection{Episode 23: Illegal Fake Goblin Ham Meat Ring}
\DndDropCapLine{A}s we join the action, our “heroes” are busy busying themselves with busy work in Hope’s Rest, getting one last week of city life in before they’re stuck on a boat for an unknown amount of time.\medskip
Kolo is doing crime, Gary is fighting it. Together, they’ll keep each other in business forever, because also Gary keeps relapsing into his new drug addiction. For some reason, every time he falls asleep with his mouth open, he seems to get more addicted to Kolo’s drugs.\medskip
Esme presents Gary with his special new shoes. They light up and scoot along and they are the best shoes ever.\medskip
Esme then gives a pep-talk to her lab staff. It is not particularly peppy, but at least it is talky.\medskip
Derek Bobacious, everyone’s favourite old person, because who else would everyone’s favourite old person be, Archicunt? What a ridiculous concept…. arrives to look after the bank while Rocky’s looking after the stone thing. Derek’s here now.\medskip
The crew then rides off towards Port Averdale. Nothing happens. Nothing at all. All the way there. What is this shit?\medskip
They arrive in Port Averdale, bored as fuck.\medskip
It’s pretty fancy.\medskip
It is decided that in this town they should be a troop of travelling entertainers, for very little reason. Gary is a magician called The Pope, with Fishy as his glamorous assistant, and Kolo dressed in a rabbit suit, that Pilch would never have got on him if he wasn’t so high all the time.\medskip
Esme is a Gabrin banker called Hardrip.\medskip
Port Averdale is a cool place with forieng foods.\medskip
Gary’s on the lookout for a theatre. He finds an open-air theatre called The Triangle, and asks a local why it has 4 sides. Apparently it’s 2 triangles put together. Gary’s mind is\medskip
B L O W N\medskip
Hardrip tries to buy The Triangle with all that money he has.\medskip
They head towards (but not in) the sea, to find a boat.\medskip
Kolo hears that there’s two options, one with two sub-options, first an exploring ship, or, second, a ship with a captain who is mad or a captain who is unscrupulous.\medskip
FIshwank tries to fuck his way onto a boat. It for sure works. He fucks a whole bunch of sailors. Then he leaves the boat again, having achieved nothing but sex. And also money. Because of course.\medskip
Kolo goes off to investigate the potential of boats to Masuda. Gary goes off to a pub called Rum and Ham or some shit like that, where the unscrupulous captains go.\medskip
Gary orders a Rum Ham and a Ham Rum. He eats one and drinks the other, then asks the whole bar who the most unscrupulous captain is. No one puts their hands up, but one guy says he can tell him who is. Then, Gary asks them to say the name of the most unscrupulous captain they know. They all talk at the same time and he has no idea what they said.\medskip
Fishwank tries to fuck the barman but then gets bored when he thinks he’s poor.\medskip
Hardrip tries to invest in the bar, and ends up pimping out Fishy.\medskip
Gary talks to the guy who wanted to talk to him. Apparently Captain Someone will do anything for money, just like Fishy. Kolo ribbits, because he’s a boy frog rabbit and also because he is still SO HIGH.\medskip
Captain Someone has had a box seized by the Port Authority, who are apparently dicks, so it’s fine to steal from them. Apparently if we get it back, he might want to let us in his boat.\medskip
The gang go to visit Captain Someone on his boat, who is a bird.\medskip
He’s a bird man, with pretty colourful feathers and a nice hat. He’s pretty great.\medskip
Hardrip asks if the bird likes riddles. He does not. Neither does Hardrip.\medskip
Kolo strokes the feathery man.\medskip
They agree to steal the box and pay him 500gp and then he’ll take them all to the place.\medskip
Gary makes the feathery man agree that they’re going to leave at dusk tomorrow.\medskip
They all leave to go and do all the things, and say they’ll be back with the box, which is apparently full of spices.\medskip
Once outside, Gary announces a spectacular magic show magically spectacle spectacular. Everyone gets super hyped. By jove, this is going to be the best fucking magic show there’s ever been in this fucking town. Look at that rabbit. And that beautiful woman. The magic show is going to be at sundown tomorrow at The Triangle.\medskip
This is when they’ll go on the boat, and everyone will think they’ll be doing a magic show on the other side of town. He makes sure that all the authorities and church people hear him.\medskip
When everyone realises that they don’t actually get to do a magic show, they get a bit sad.\medskip
The plan is finalised:\medskip
1) A box labelled “HAM” will be stolen from Ham and Rum Kolo will feign death within the box\medskip
2) Gary, in his Police capacity as well as his Magician capacity, will report to the Authorities that he saw some people moving boxes that said “HAM” but sounded like Gabrins\medskip
3) The Authorities will investigate the crates and find one living Gabrin and a dead Gabrin (because Kolo has a ring that makes him look dead)\medskip
4) They’ll impound the box, because there’s clearly some weird fake ham ring going on\medskip
5) Kolo will break out and steal the box\medskip
Points 1 to 4 go off without a hitch, the Authorities open the box and find not ham, but a live Gabrin and a dead Gabrin dressed as a rabbit, and Kolo gets taken off into the impound.\medskip
Esme and Gary go off to Rum and Ham for a nice night, because they don’t hang out enough. Esme recommends him some new foods to try.\medskip
Fishwank goes to keep an eye of the impound warehouse place.\medskip
Kolo is in the box, still dressed as a rabbit. He maybe hears something else in the box house. Maybe not, though.\medskip
After a few hours of being dead, he cuts himself out of the box.\medskip
He goes snooping in the boxes and finds lots of hollowed-out vegetables. Some have been used to smuggle drugs. Some have… not… been used for that.\medskip
They’re fuckfruits.\medskip
Fruits you can fuck.\medskip
Kolo does not find a big box full of spice, which is what we want.\medskip
Kolo tries to look under a door and does it so badly that his eye bleeds. Then he opens the door instead.\medskip
A whole shit-tonne of guards are playing cards on the other side. They are not “Playing Cards”.\medskip
Kolo quietly empties a box, cuts eyeholes in it, and shuffles along the ground. It is great. Nothing could go better.\medskip
Kolo realises that the best solution to this problem is to set fire to all the boxes.\medskip
It is not currently known if the important box is on fire.\medskip
Let’s face it, it probably is.\medskip
Kolo is still in a box, shuffling around this burning room.\medskip
The two nastiest guards run out to get some water from somewhere.\medskip
Kolo NOW starts checking boxes. He finds the important box. It’s quite near the fire.\medskip
NEVER FEAR! Fishwank is here, and he’s the local fire marshal. The guards, unreasonably, expect him to be able to put out the fire.\medskip
Clearly, this small fire means that this whole building is a write off and they should take all the flammable things, including spice, out of the building before it causes more damage.\medskip
Somehow, all of this works out pretty much fine.\medskip
The other guards turn up, along with some for-real firemen who know how to put out fires for some reason. They don’t stop him leaving, because they think they can put out the fire, for some reason.\medskip
The guards save the box of spice, on Fishwank’s command.\medskip
Fishwank liberates the barrel containing Kolo.\medskip
Suddenly, one of the guards carrying the spicebox falls asleep. It definitely to do with the invisible smoke, and not the blowdart that someone who couldn’t be Kolo, because Kolo’s dead, definitely didn’t fire at him.\medskip
The rest of the guards help Pilch get the carts to the ports where they’ll be safe from the invisible fire.\medskip
Again, everything goes fine. It’s weird.\medskip
The awesome alibi magic show isn’t even needed.\medskip
LATER, AFTER CELEBRATIONS:\medskip
The gang are going to the ship, with the important box, a box of Rum Ham, and a barrel of Ham Rum.\medskip
Gary’s looking at the sky, feeling happy, so he definitely spots that they’re being followed by a load of shadowy guys and a floating guy who looks like that scary guy they met underground that time.\medskip
They stand about, discussing how that’s probably not great, when all of a sudden, Gary stops working. Some dicks start lurking out of the alleyway at them. Kolo puts some shit in Gary’s mouth, but he still can’t move.\medskip
Fishy’s Woolfe puts himself under Gary, and everyone except Esme, starts running (or being run, in Gary’s case) away.\medskip
Esme is too slow, falls behind the rest and gets flung up in the air by some crazy force.\medskip
Gary regains control of his legs, jumps off the wolf, and just absolutely pegs it like some weirdass bull, using the combined powers of sprinting, drugs and heelies, he scoops up and picks up Esme as weird armoured… people....? run towards her. Kolo runs only slightly slower than him and fires a shot off.\medskip
They run off towards the boat, and get Captain Something to drive the boat away as fast as he can, because the Inquisition have taken an interest in his spice, if you know what I mean.\medskip
FIshwank fires a ballista at them. It misses.\medskip
Some of them fall over on some ballbearings.\medskip
Everyone gets on the boat, and the armoured guys are left on the shore like dickheads.\medskip
The boat’s sailing away, but whut’s all this? It’s not moving.\medskip
AHHH THE GUY’S DOING SOMETHING FUCKED UP!!!!!!\medskip
The boat’s stopped. Everyone’s going to die.\medskip
But what’s this?\medskip
Kolo makes a small movement to himself, not looking like he expects much. All of a sudden, a light appears behind his eyes. The boat jerks forward, gets pulled back slightly, and then…. BAM! It flies forwards, free from the magical force that was holding it in place.\medskip
Kolo drops unconscious and the group sail off into the silent star-filled night, towards the mysterious continent, from whose shore none return.
