\subsection{Episode 9.1: Kolo's Tale (Part 1): The Greasy Rage of Clan Stanri }
\DndDropCapLine{T}he group gather round the warm camp fire as Kolo begin's to tell the great tale of Goblin legend. That of revered emancipator Grumpy Stanri...\medskip
Grumpy Stanri wakes up one morning with a premonition. The great dark wagon of the Muglabiyet isn’t being pulled by anyone. What’s going on? He assembles his Gabrin crack team and goes out to go to a place to find out.\medskip
First though, they need to find a boat to get there. They head towards a town by a river to see if they can get one.\medskip
As they approach they notice the humans in the fields running away, locking themselves in the town walls.\medskip
The gang approach the gates and talk to the 2 guards in the towers above the gate. Kri'igo ask what everyone’s so scared of. Apparently it’s them. The guards are dicks, if we’re honest. They racist and call us Pikeys, which is a reference to the Pike wars, where humans put Gabrin childs on pikes and ate them like Kebabs.\medskip
They tell us that we can’t come in and we say we’ll go away and not bother them. We head towards the burned out remains of a village outside the town walls, and then Tan and Dev start sneaking, with a plan to scale the town walls.\medskip
They scamper up to the top, and Dev misses with some blow darts, trying to hit one of those guards, because they’re dicks.\medskip
Tan’lata does not miss at the guard she’s aiming at. He doesn’t have a chance to scream before he hits the ground.\medskip
The other guy just about gets to raise the alarm before Dev hits him with a blowdart. It makes him feel a bit woozy, then Tan runs along the top of the palisade wall, murdering him with 2 arrows as she runs towards him. As she gets up to him, she takes some of his meat out with her hands.\medskip
The alarm is raised, bells ringing across the town.\medskip
The rest of the gabrins ask Dev to open the doors to the town. She starts, but she’s shit scared and wimpering like a little bitch because she’s never seen death up close, and now she’s seeing an awful lot of death.\medskip
Tan’lata is not helping to open the gate, because she’s just war-criminalling (during peace time!) all over the place. She tries to set fire to a house, but it’s made of stone, so she barges in through the window as they’re trying to board it up.\medskip
Inside there's a granny standing by an oven, a man running to go and get something from another room, and a small group of terrified children.\medskip
Within 20 seconds or so: the granny has her head in the oven, burning to death; the man has his thumb bitten off, and a poker sticking through his mouth and out of the back of his head; and Tan’lata has slammed the door of the oven shut, decapitating the granny. She then turns her attention to the children, and luckily, our attention turns outside.\medskip
Dev has got the drawbridge down and now needs to lift the bar on the door. She ties one end of a rope to the bar and another to her weasel. She tells the weasel to jump out of the window, but the rope is too long, and it hits the ground like a dick.\medskip
As the gabrins regroup outside of the murder house, a fresh wave of murderous humans arrive to try and take down the gabrins.\medskip
Grumpy heads into the house of viscera to perform a necro-terrogation of the father’s head. The severed head spews racial hatred at the goblins, potentially justified at this point. He reluctantly shares that the town has no large vessels itself, but rather serves as a port for trading. The man’s undead head is dismayed to see his children’s dismembered and brutalised corpses. Fml head man.\medskip
After a brief disposal of the new guards, the gang follow Kri'igo along the city walls towards the river. However, they are set upon by another bunch of guards, this time being led by a fancily dressed guard, all shiny and long haired.\medskip
The fight is brutal and short, and full of greased up, rage filled barbarians who are more than capable of separating a heavily armoured, fully grown human man into two parts with a single blow. Well, one barbarian at least.\medskip
The group take a moment to rest and recover, with Kri'igo gratefully taking Grumpy’s teet to restore his vitality. He suckles long and hard, his strength slowly pouring back into each muscle, his tongue savouring his father’s bitter-sweet, musky milk. There is an intimacy to the action of the kind that can only exist between a man and his eldest son.\medskip
Devvy is in awe of Tan’lata’s skills and requests that the older goblin become her new mother. Tan’lata accepts and requests her new child to gather fire wood, an important task for an adult to know how to perform, and place it all around the villager’s houses. The wood is lit, and the fate of the town’s people sealed as securely as their temporary, yet also ironically permanent, battens.\medskip
Grumpy heads down to the river to seek out a boat. He finds a small rowing boat and sits in it in order to attempt once more to commune with his god. But before he can receive no reply, the boat is tipped over by an angry, piratey dwarf. Tan’lata is able to loose an arrow into the dwarfs leg. However, the fight is brought to a stop by the embarrassing and womanly pacifism of the dwarves.\medskip
The dwarves inform the goblins that they had been trying to pull off their own long-short plan to trick the town’s most virile and able-bodied men into working as deck hands on their sailing boat. But since they were now all dead, if the goblins wanted to secure passage across the sea, then they would have to work. Grumpy, work shy and haggard, accepts with a wink.\medskip
The goblins enter a row boat with the 2 dwarves and head to the larger vessel. After a long rest and several hours on the river, the larger boat comes into sight. Grumpy utters a single short command and the dwarves no longer exist as living, breathing, love making creatures. The goblins hear a splash from the other side of the larger boat, but are too caught up in the joy of owning a boat, and the anxiety of trying to figure out how to sail it, to notice.\medskip
