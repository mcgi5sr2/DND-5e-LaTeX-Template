\subsection{Episode 11: Voyagers of the Cloudship Nontaprise}
\DndDropCapLine{A}wakening from a fever dream…\medskip
What the fuck happened yesterday? Did some shopping. Riphard setup the bank - Delilah joined the party. Had dream - told about magic bush - Gulan. Lazarus is a dick that roped Delilah into this. Bobacious walks in wearing a casual suit - purple and yellow 7 inch lappels. I feel thoroughly inadequate. Delilah is weird about banks. We spend some time noticing that only people of a certain ethnicity wear purple and yellow suits. We go and talk to a map guy, give him some information, he gives us a map… We want to steal his big map. Kolo goes back and becomes this guys personal adventurer, in return of better maps.\medskip
Riphard Research (in the church) -\\
Erasser - other continent, has two sub-regions.\\
Nanduan and Asuma Nanduan - people work for themselves, no ruling class/ruling class (meritocracy)\\
Hearthrusts -nothing\\
Inquisition\\\
Controlled by church: Monetary system is gold/silver/copper (equivalent to ours) - different coins, same values.\\\medskip
Kolo meets a cartographer and agrees to share his "RangerUA" knowledge of new locations with him in return for updated maps. Also secures continent map, and local area map.\medskip
We have horses, yay! None of them are cock-unicorns.\medskip
We climb a mountain - I’m awesome at it, everyone else is a weak pansy.\medskip
We get attacked by harpies. Delilah and kolo try to kill themselves. I boss save kolo, delilah gets away from Riphard, but then doesn’t kill herself.\medskip
We all kill harpies, delilah kills them extra good.\medskip
“Signs of the seven around the rim of the tunnel”\medskip
We find it, we find the bush. We spark up… We end up in Dali-land.\medskip
Some of us (goblins and dwarf) wander off into the desert. Pilch grabs the goblins.\medskip
We jump off floating sand platforms. Drown in purple sand.\medskip
We wake up on a floating sky-boat, get attacked by some evil shadow creatures.\medskip
Delilah boss-shoots a rainbow at one.\medskip
I shadow-strike the living fuck out of another thing.\medskip
Riphard commands one to “leave” so it vanishes.\medskip
We kill the others, I absorb one of them.\medskip
Lazarus shows up. We all fall through the sky.\medskip
We get picked up and dropped into a garden. Lazurus cries a red liquid.\medskip
Delilah is a crazy sky-captain, thinks lazarus is Gary.\medskip
Lazarus got BIG.\medskip
We all start to feel hazy. “Do you not understand… that was the hand of Synne”\medskip
We wake up - there’s a big stone creature… It is not anatomically correct.\medskip
We meet Gary… The standing stone that stood up…
