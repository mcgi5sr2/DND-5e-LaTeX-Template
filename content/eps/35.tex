\section{Episode 35: Lord of Lightning Shifts His Gaze}

\begin{multicols}{2}

\DndDropCapLine{T}he gang wake up in Laz’s waiting room, and are called in to see the boss man. He takes Mark into another room and does weird shit to him to teach him not to do so much time travel. Kolo and Myron go ferreting through Laz’s shit. Myron finds that it’s spooky and he doesn’t like it. Kolo definitely doesn’t find and steal a book. Laz comes out with Mark, who looks sad now. He gets sucked back into Bernie and accused of touching a cassock and kicking a dog, but does not get sent to hell for his actions. Dawn rises over Port Akiano. The Good Ship Gary is in the dry dock, with repairs starting slowly, but in earnest. Daisuke (the interpreter) comes back, with quotes for passage upstream. He is immediately sent off to get quotes to rent a boat instead. He’s paid lots of money, so he’s okay doing this.\medskip

Kolo, having finally got over the worst of his illness, goes on a holiday spending spree, buying an incredible amount of sake, a large amount of ballbearings and a bowl of fruit. Exme converts Stanri into water mode, which uses up all the group’s supply of arm bands and swimming caps. Myron sneaks off to try and do a nice thing and buy everyone cool robes, seemingly forgetting that they already did this yesterday. These ones are loads cooler, though and everyone has personalised ones. Riphard immediately storms off to get an even nicer one. It’s crazy nice. It’s a solid gold shiny mess. So nice that he needs to show it off to whoever’s in charge. The rest of the gang crack open the sake, sensing that this might take a while. He’s definitely not going to burn anything down.\medskip

Riphard meets the lord. He’s awesome and cool and everything goes fine. He pumps him for information about the rules regarding the collection of loot, his opinions on the other lords and then starts drinking a awful lot of sake. Myron has purchased a travel ping pong table. Kolo and Bernie have a little moment. The little boat sets sail, and the gang have a lovely time bobbing along. Exme practices a little ping pong and Myron proclaims her to be a natural. It’s the happiest moment of her life.\medskip

After a couple of days, they arrive at a little fishing village. The Golden Man disembarks, and the village rejoices. Everyone drinks sake and it’s the happiest moment of their lives. The gang head out into the wilds, looking for the Lord of Lightning. Myron does what he is trained for and looks for monsters harassing villages. They find the popped, wrinkled corpses of balloon cows, all killed by something nasty. The corpses get fresher as they walk, Myron thinks they must be getting close. They make Bernie climb a tree, in the hope that he gets eaten by the thing. Disappointingly, he doesn’t, but Myron thinks he’s worked out where it is, and they all leave. Bernie tries to catch them up. Myron reckons that this thing just does lightning all the time rather than as an attack, and Exme says she reckons that means they should be able to find it using a compass. They track it down pretty quick after that.\medskip

They come over a small rise and see the awesome lightning beast which looks great and is awesomely running right at them in a really cool way. The Lord of Lightning shifts its gaze, and directs its attention their way. Electricity escapes as it leaves destruction in its wake. Bernie throws Kolo a cool new bow, and everyone gets ready for battle, with a variety of levels of effectiveness, coolness and cowardice. Kolo uses extensive magic to make his catch of the bow look super cool. Riphard sings a cool song and Myron prepares to slice a bitch. Guns are cracking, bombs are smacking, cat o' tails whips her lashings. Howling like a horde of demons greatest battle cry, the violent lightning lord points its arms into the sky. Lightning arcs off the beast and zaps the Gabrins and Bern. It runs up to Myron, who slides underneath it, slashing and blasting its soft underbelly. It spins around and tries to slash him, but Myron’s way to cool.\medskip

Rip runs up and shoots, but does not hit his mark. The Lord of Lightning's closer now, the gang world is only rain and cloud. They’re not sure they have the power needed to smite this evil down. Myron continues to be awesome. Kolo realises he’s not getting any attention any more, and so finally catches the bow. He uses it, and it’s pretty rad. Lightning happens again, and Exme gets pretty fucked up. The beast (who may or may not be altered) smells blood and runs over to her, with Myron stuck into it with his bayonet. Riphard shouts “MOVE!” but no one does. Myron just can’t stop kicking arse. Kolo lines up his target like the huntsman points his rifle. Waves of flaxen flames as he mutters his magic title. He dismembers the beast with a fire arrow and the foul thing is felled. The luckless hostage has been thoroughly fried.\medskip

Kolo and Exme set about the thing taking it to pieces. They find it has special electricy skin and an electricy heart bit. They have a nice sit down meal and eat some of it. Myron takes the head as proof of carnage. They head off to the local lord to show off what cool heros they are, before they go killing some orcs. When they get to that guy’s house he has gravel in special patterns and all sorts of shit. It’s boring and rubbish. And his house is made of paper. Myron tries to knock on the door, but accidentally punches a hole in it. They get led into the house by a robot geisha lady. The Gabrins have lots of questions. They ask if she knows Otoria. She replies that she definitely does not, oh no, not at all, definitely not. They are taken into the lord guy, and the Geisha robot says that they’re awesome and killed the Lord of Lightning and are going to kill the orcs. Everyone then immediately leaves, all the important stuff being done. According to Daisuke, the lord’s a dick. The gang head out south and go to kill them some orcs.\medskip
