\subsection{Episode 9: Live Free or R.I.P. Hard (In loving memory of Lady Otoria Hearthrust)}
\DndDropCapLine{T}he screaming continues.\\
Holly: “what what whaaaa?!”\\
Holly runs to the door: “Leroyyyy mmmmmJeeennnnkinnnnsssss”\\
The group crowds around the door. Clanking machinery and voices are heard in the distance\\
Man 1 “Tony, we need to break the door down quickly.”\\
Tony (probably) “Don’t worry, she knows what she’s doing”\\
They don’t know the doors are unlocked to this super secure facility.\\
Esme is confused about everything.\\
We open the door and see 3 stunned figures outside the door: burly black man (Theo), half orc (Tony), and Eastern looking lady with daggers. They draw their weapons.\\
MEANWHILE\\
Otoria explores the upper levels carrying around the 3 drinks she got for the group. She reflects on the peace and quiet: that is never a good thing. She hears heavy footsteps bound up the stairs.\\
Otoria freezes and watches the doorway to the stairs.\\
Man 3 “Round up the others. Take care of the hostages, right Alexander?”\\
Man 4 (gruff voice) “Don’t tell me how to do my work.”\\
Otoria approaches Alexander and scolds him for mistreating Man 4.\\
The men note Otoria’s notable weaponry and draw weapons.\\
MEANWHILE\\
Exme is fucking on it and pops a shot off first. She misses.\\
The dagger lady “eyes up Kolo” and waits. Lustfully.\\
Tony gets a glancing spear blow on Kolo (more innuendo).\\
The dagger lady now stabs Kolo for some reason who cries out for Exme’s help.\\
Everyone misses everyone else.\\
MEANWHILE\\
Otoria gets wet for some reason.\\
MEANWHILE\\
Pilch tries to use his new sword. He sucks as expected. He tries to retcon it with luck, forgetting AGAIN about his raven that magically gives everyone advantage. He now magically hits here for minimum damage, giving her the equivalent of a paper cut. Some magical extra damage comes out of nowhere and she explodes. That’s a bad paper cut.\\
MEANWHILE\\
Alexander tries to spear Otoria and bang her (... come on). He fucking rapes her (not litereally). Otoria is in bad shape.\\
Otoria respond with a fancy sword swipe. It’s pretty fucking fancy. The men look impressed and injured.\\
MEANWHILE\\
Riphard talks to his bullets. For 6 seconds. You’d have thought he could manage more than that, but no.\\
Exme kills Theo.\\
“Frank” (Tony?) takes Holly hostages and backs away threatening to kill her if we move.\\
MEANWHILE\\
Otoria continues to battle the two men without dying, which is an improvement.\\
MEANWHILE\\
Pilch thinks about taking off Holly’s clothes. Very inappropriate for an unconscious hostage. Probably telling of his character. Pilch does something involving magic. It didn’t seem important.\\
MEANWHILE\\
One of the dudes tries to bang Otoria again, but misses so badly he makes it super easy for Otoria to stab him. Otoria misses. But in her miss scares the fuck out of the men. They literally shit their pants. Then she remembers she actually had advantage and they retroactively take damage, probably from the pant shitting. The guy drops his weapon.\\
MEANWHILE\\
A large inky black void has surrounded the doorway, pilch, and the hostage situation. This is probably Pilch’s fault.\\
Riphard says “Fuck this noise again” and pats Kolo on the head 10 times.\\
Exme and Kolo looks at each other and realise their opportunity. A vault full of invaluable secrets, during a robbery, with the keeper conveniently unconscious and subdued.... It would terrible if some of the items went missing.\\
Exme uses her identify machine, but it beeps confusedly at her. She walks off.\\
Frank (the girl was Tony all along) panics and drops Holly in the black shit mist. He runs in the direction he thinks the stairs are in.\\
Kolo runs into the black shit mist for some reason. He trips over Holly and falls on his face.\\
MEANWHILE\\
The lady tries to stab Otoria… and misses. The battle rages on.\\
MEANWHILE\\
Pilch reabsorbs the darkness into his ass. He approaches Kolo and offers him a hand to his feet. Kolo thanks fishy.\\
MEANWHILE\\
Alexander runs off allowing Otoria to stab him. She misses. Otoria tries to intimidate the already scared man, commanding him the halt. He stops. Fucking Jedi shit. Otoria then swipes at the lady and she’s barely standing on her feet, crumpling her breastplate.\\
Riphard commands the running man to DANCE! He stops and starts dancing, telling the others to subdue him.\\
Exme is homing in on something and finds a small ring.\\
Frank continues to dance aggressively and sexually.\\
Kolo wants Pilch to throw him and jumps into his arms.\\
MEANWHILE\\
The lady tries to stab Otoria again. Misses again.\\
MEANWHILE\\
Pilch runs with Kolo and throws him at the now stationary and non-dancing Frank. Pilch uses some kind of homing device and bullseyes Kolo into Frank’s face.\\
Kolo does a barrel roll in the air and headbutts Frank while stabbing him, knocking Frank out cold.\\
MEANWHILE\\
The mighty battles draws to an inevitable conclusion. Otoria does some more unnecessary. fancy sword shit and opens some sardines. She cuts the ladies face off and struts towards the still terrified man.\\
“Everything went much better for you because you did what I say. It will continue to be better for you if you continue to do what I do. Tell me everything”.\\
The terrified man spits blood and tells Otoria that they were robbing the place (no shit).\\
Otoria wonders if the man parties. He does. He tells her they took the party people hostage. He says they didn’t want violence, despite rushing Otoria immediately on sight. He said she looked like a badass. Otoria tells him to go to bed and rethink his life. Settle down. Get a job. Contribute productively to society. He agrees to have a nap and try to figure his life out. Otoria breaks his spear and lets him be.\\
“By the way, never seen a woman fight like you.”\\
“I am Otoria Hea…”\\
“LET ME FINISH…. Except for Lark”\\
“Thanks for the cryptic clue.”\\
“No, you already know who that is. The blonde asian lady.”\\
“Ohhhhh yeeeaaaaah.”\\
MEANWHILE\\
Riphard practices his bondage techniques, convincing the others not to skin the man.\\
Exme quickly works out how the fancy 17 lock door works for Riphard.\\
Kolo agrees to guard the treasures (yeah….).\\
The group take the unconscious Frank and now-conscious Holly to the security HQ within the tower, which is apparently just the guards at the door.\\
Riphard explains to Holly about the robbery and non-so-subtly implies the need for a reward.\\
The guards, who have no fucking idea what’s going on at this super secure treasure tower, inquire as to what’s going on. Pilch tries to explain to the guards what’s happening despite all this being Riphard’s idea. Who is oddly quiet, scribbling notes, probably about their lax security procedures.\\
It turns out that the 2 guards are part of the robbery. This explains a lot. Riphard takes notes harder. “TRUSTWORTHY GUARDS!!!!”.\\
Riphard quick draws his pistol and shouts “THUNDERCUNT!” and shoots one of the motherfuckers.\\
Kolo hears the distant rumble of Riphard’s gun. Exme does not.\\
One of the guards doesn’t hit Riphard.\\
Pilch drops an ear (wtf) and further confirms himself to be very much a Stephen character by looking for the best way to run away. He contemplates jumping into shit to surrounding himself with matter similar to himself. Holly and the unconscious half orc block the corridor. Pilch stabs the unconscious half orc to Riphards confusion.\\
Riphard misses with his whip.\\
The men stab Pilch in the face with a greatsword and miss with another.\\
Pilch tries to actually do something useful and stab the dudes (totally after sending the Raven out for advantage). AND MISSES LIKE A CUNT.\\
MEANWHILE\\
Otoria eats some grey goo, totally oblivious to the thunderous blast from below. She decides it’s party time and descends to the party room.\\
The group uncover the mystery of Imota Kan (NAKATOMI BACKWARDS OMG) and it turns out the whole thing is a Die Hard rip off. Pretty sweet. All the dudes are named after the Die Hard people too. Fuck. Does that mean it’s Christmas?\\
Hans (come on) cuts a guy's head off as Otoria enters the room. Everyone starts making Die Hard references.\\
Otoria banters with Hans. There’s a lot of talk of mess and shit shows. No one likes mess. Hans explains he’s here to rob the tower (YEAH WE GET IT). Turns out Hans threw the party in his own honour, what a cunt. The conversation goes on for a while in true hollywood style with the villain fully explaining his plan for some reason.\\
Otoria tries to convince Hans that his men in the vault are dead. Hans proposes a bet to see who’s dead.\\
MEANWHILE\\
Riphard starts singing Firework by Katy Perry, who totally exists in this universe, inspiring Pilch and Holly.\\
The evil dudes miss.\\
Pilch kills a motherfucker and kicks him off the bridge.\\
Riphard fucking whips the other dude’s feet, who entangled in whip stumbles off the bridge to his grizzly doom. Wilhelm scream\\
MEANWHILE\\
Otoria notices Kolo and Exme sneaking out from the all too convenient poop-chutes-come-ventilation shafts. They now know what it’s like to be TV dinners… after they’ve been digested, shat out, and flushed away.\\
The hollywood conversation continues. Otoria tries to walk away, but the henchmen fire their crossbows at her, but all miss leaving an Otoria shaped arrangement in the wall behind her.\\
Exme left a crate conveniently in the party hall last week, which now starts beeping and humming.\\
Kolo looses an arrow at a henchman, killing him clean. HEADSHOT. His eye extends out of his face on the end of the arrow. Gross.\\
Exme takes a shot at Hans and wounds him.\\
Marco (a henchman) hits Otoria with a bolt.\\
Pilch and Riphard don’t put two and two together, and thinking the job is now done saunter back off into the building at a leisurely pace.\\
Kristal stabs Exme.\\
Otoria does a combat roll on the spot instead of just turning around like a normal person. She sprints towards Hans with the her sword held out in front of her and completely misses Hans.\\
Kolo gets hit with an arrow.\\
Some lady with a katana slashes Otoria while she clumsily runs at Hans.\\
Kolo misses terribly with a poison arrow.\\
Exme action rolls away from Kristal, shooting her to pieces all over a nearby hostage, then dodges a bolt.\\
Pilch and Riphard hear the distant sounds of battle and start sprinting towards the stairs like the brave men one of them is.\\
Hans goes mental at the sight of his dying men.\\
Otoria slashes some people.\\
Kolo gets his with another arrow.\\
Lark (the one with long blond hair) starts singing a song of focus. It sounds like a BabyMetal ballad.\\
Kolo breaks out a DISTILLED poison arrow, and finally kills his tormenter.\\
The forgotten whirring crate finally does something, and falls open. A small roar emanates as a small mecha-bear appears from the dust. It’s super cute. Exme looks surprised in a motherly way.\\
Exme shoots another henchman and fucks him right up. He dead. Exme inspects the mecha-bear, which starts doing a little excited tippy tap dance for her. Everyone’s heart melts. Except Exme, who looks unmoved, the heartless bitch.\\
Pilch finally appears from the stair well. He does a ranged attack for a pathetic amount of damage to the singing lark.\\
Riphard enters and grabs his pistol he had stored behind his head in his hood, totally like out of Die Hard. GET IT? He shoots Lark for much more damage than Pilch, but she still singin’.\\
Otoria dies hard. As usual.\\
Lark, angry at being shot twice, runs at Pilch and Riphard and swipes at them. Riphard gets hit hard.\\
Kolo continues to use his fanciest of fancy arrows and fires at Hans, wounding him badly.\\
The mecha-bear adorably bounds towards Hans, falling over as he does so. AWWW.\\
Exme then fires at Hans, but is distracted by the sickeningly cute mecha-bear.\\
Pilch fucking grabs Lark like a full on rapist and/or Donald Trump. He moves on her like a bitch, suplexing the bitch down the stairs over his head. She’s still fucking singing though, amazing.\\
Riphard runs over and touches up the unconscious Otoria. As usual.\\
Hans tries to stab a prone Otoria, but resembles someone playing a larger hand-knife game, stabbing between her splayed limbs. It’s actually quite impressive. A smattering of applause breaks out.\\
Otoria gets up looking angry. She mightily swings her greatsword at Hans, right at his crotch. It turns out Hans is wearing a very elaborate cod-piece and he laughs, unfazed and unhurt. Otoria runs away. Hans tries to swipe at her, but she’s too nimble.\\
Lark says something at Pilch in Forin. “DIE PEEG”. This is actually seamlessly part of the song. She double slashes Pilch who dies. HARD.\\
Kolo lets out more of the fancy arrows at Hans, who’s still standing.\\
The mecha-bear approaches Hans and gently tugs at Hans’ pantaloons. His stony face softens briefly before he (gently) kicks the bear to one side.\\
Riphard misses Hans with a shot as Hans approaches. Hans triple stabs Riphard, who crumples to the ground, mortally wounded.\\
Otoria hits Lark with an arrow who speaks back in Forin (and song). Otoria tells Lark that she’s gonna kill “this guy then deal with that guy”, who doesn’t understand. Lark suddenly charges Otoria and beheads her with her Katana. Otoria dies suuuuper hard. Like for real. Dead, dead.\\
Kolo looses a final fancy arrow at Hans who finally dies. It’s surprisingly anti-climactic.\\
Exme shoots at Lark in a rage, who is bleeding heavily.\\
Riphard and Pilch are slightly less dead looking, but still dying.\\
Lark, still singing, but more mournfully now that her dead leader is dead, swings at Exme, who ALSO DIES.\\
Kolo is the last man standing and launches the angriest and fanciest arrow he can muster at the sight of his sister falling in battle, which hits. The fury contained within this shot, particularly due to Kolo’s small stature, finally slays the lethal Lark.\\
Kolo rushes to Exme’s aid, who flickers to life. Then to Riphard, just swinging a fist into his chest like the Fonz. Riphard sputters to life.\\
Pilch sooooooo nearly dies. Kolo rushes to Pilch last and again Fonz’s Pilch back to life. Pilch awakens.\\
The group inspect Otoria’s very dead remains. Apparently the rest of the group know she is an automaton, but not Riphard. I’m not sure why.\\
Pilch fruitlessly tries to reanimate the lifeless Otoria-bot.\\
Exme uses her convenient identifier to gives everyone an in-depth backstory to the now deceased and never to be seen again Otoria. Turns out she was a dwarven sex-bot with a soul.\\
An intrigued Riphard removes the bandages from Otoria-bot’s body-less head to see what a sex-bot looks like. She’s got a pretty creepy head. He’s not a fan.\\
Exme is moved to tears at the complexity of the machinery. Kolo wants to wear her dead face as a mask (a goblin tradition).\\
Feeling bad Kolo stuffs his totally-not-stolen items back into the waste holes.\\
Holly starts untying hostages.\\
Pilch attacks Riphard for some reason, who startled from the shock of battle lets a hip-shot off at Pilch, who dies again. Kolo lets an arrow off at Riphard despite seeing what just unfolded, like a complete cunt. Thankfully he misses and the situation diffuses… for now. Exme shocks Pilch back to life. Tensions and emotions are running high following the intense battle and loss of a “friend”, and everyone should calm down in time. This does not bode well for the group’s future.\\
Pilch, Exme, and the bear take Otoria’s mecha-remains somewhere.\\
Kolo tries to get money out of Holly and steal money off the hostages. Riphard wants to discuss business with Holly, in private. Riphard insists on taking his share for himself. Kolo takes the rest, along with less notorious valuable looking items from the vault.\\
Lazarus talks to the group in their dreams. Kolo’s really angry. Lazarus explains to the group Otoria’s “true” identify, and what would have become of her had he not intervened in an attempt to justify himself. It seems pretty reasonable. Kolo isn’t convinced and swears vengeance, ever the rational member of the group. Lazarus calmly tells Kolo that there is only one way to “make things better”, which is to reclaim the path of “decent and noble” souls like Otoria to heaven, which has been corrupted by the church. Pretty reasonable. Kolo is unconvinced and swears on Lazarus’ “death”. Lazarus, who by all accounts seems like a pretty decent bloke at this point, further presses the point he rescued us from inevitable deaths that he was not involved in orchastrating, and gave us new leases of life in order to improve the world. Exme thanks Lazarus for his candidness.\\
Pilch wonders that Lazarus’ powers are limited, gesturing to his arm, he says he doesn’t work for Lazarus, they just share the same master, can’t he bring him back. Lazarus sighs at Pilch’s stupidity and naivity of the current god-politik. That’s the whole reason he got us involved, to try and fix this shit. Pilch further questions Lazarus about it all, and Laz starts to get angry. “Synne is super shit at the moment. You’re a shit mortal and have been granted some of his power, and you dare question it? Go fuck yourself.” Pilch presses Laz for more help, advice, information, anything to prevent further casualties in the hardships ahead. Laz says he has withheld information for fear of our interrogation. He shares the “knowledge of the breaking”.\\
Many centuries ago, the church believed they were doing good, and utilised a most powerful artifact. The Great Stone of the Eight™ (though you would call it Seven…). It sundered the world from the gods and beyond, and so they believed from danger. However, the centuries have not been kind to the church, and the world, and the church has become corrupt, endangering the world more than anything that came before. The only hope for the souls of the entire world, and for all in eternity, is to “break the seal”. When pressed, this means unlocking the gods power and bringing their power to full bear, as they were in ages past. The church will block this at all costs, but once the seal is broken, the church will either fall or be reborn. The gods will take an active role in the world again, unlike their distant current influence. The seal filters the gods power, and church bends this to their own wishes. They had good intentions to begin with, and still believe they are doing right by the world, but they are no longer. He sighs. That’s all we’ve got time for folks.\\
Pilch asks another question anyway. The dream fades and the group stir awake, but Lazarus’ voice distant explains we will need “one of several…”.\\
The group are exhausted from the power of the conversation, but do get their HP back. Woo.\\
The group gather round a campfire, and give Otoria-bot a proper send off, but plan to keep her mecha-remains in a special caravan or something, like some kind of shrine?\\
Kolo begins to tell a special story.\\
In loving memory of Lady Otoria Hearthrust. 2017-2017\\
