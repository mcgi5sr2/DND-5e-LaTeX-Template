\subsection{Episode 9.2: Kolo's Tale (Part 2): Snakes on a boat!}
\DndDropCapLine{T}The session starts: Rich is now a weasel. The barbarian is now God.\\
The Gabrins are on a dingy, not a rubber one but a proper one. The big awesome ship is drifting away from us. The might barbarian gabrin who has suddenly changed personality and voice decides to go for a lovely swim and tries to get up.\\
His daughter lassoos him which helps them to stay nearby but nearly strangles the swimmer. Tan’lata shoots an arrow at the ship and hits because how could she not but the arrow snaps because she’s a dumbass.\\
Kril-go rages like a ragey thing and power climbs up the rope. A bit later they get on the boat, TAn’lata does a wikid sick backflip on the boat then goes to look for friends.\\
The boat is full of wood but nothing fun. Dev’lada wants to use the ballistas to make a siege weasel and acquires a piece of string.\\
Tan’lata smells dwarfs downstairs and it makes her a bit wet but she pretends it’s hunger. Grumpy suggests making a dwarf friend but that isn’t going to happen.\\
Downstairs there are a few dingys and hammocks, plus some cards. They might be for playing top trumps.\\
Grumpy has been on a boat before, back when he didn’t have gout. There was something to do with ropes. HE has ideas because he is v. clever.\\
Kril-go rages through the underfloor and eats some lovely fish and gets covered in sexy oil. He has a party in the bedroom and makes a cloak.\\
Grumpy comes to a realisation that he needs wood. He remembers turny thingys and important guys stand at the back.\\
Stanri beckons the gabrins together for planning and KNOWLEDGE. Dev’leda is not very useful, she tries to see stuff and she tries to know stuff but all she is good at is making things greasy and uncomfortable.\\
Kril-go gets some cool boots and a hat to go with his cape because he’s super fashion concious. He gets letters he cant read and tries to take them to Stanri but there is a grease party going on and he falls in the water.\\
Dev’leda chats up her greasy weasel who apparantly is the only thing in the party with a clue. On the Keel is some old bloke called cap’n suresailin. WE declare it is our boat and Dev’leda tries to stop him getting on the boat even though he is obviously the only person who knows wtf is going on. He’s nimble for an old fuck\\
He is the captain and its an old as fuck ship. Stanri chats him up and Tan’lata whispers sexily in his ear but it was actually his elbow. He wants us to be crew. We agree because we have no idea what a boat is. He teaches us how to be pirates which we will be very grateful.\\
Dev’lada is friggin in the riggin with a greasy weasel. Kril-go is turning his wood. Tan’lata gets ropey Grumpy does nothing. Grumpy Stanri knows things but he doesnt know what. Tan’lata is heretycal but doesnt kill the man yet.\\
We set sail to the tune of a raptor-weasel in the rigging. The river is great. We are rollin. Rollin. Rollin down the river.\\
Stanri has a shit while he talks to his god.\\
The cap’n makes the dire mistake of showing us where we are going and being friendly. Tan’lata lets the man live by shooting him in the face, but he calls out in some weird voice o doom calling us traitors.\\
Some fookin big sea snake comes out of teh sea while the cap’n makes a big storm which is not very nice. It pops the weasel\\
Stanri saves the weasel by popping him back. Tan’lata fucks up the captain who obi’wans it outta there. Kril-go goes hack crazy on the sea snake and mashes some bits out of it. Dev’lada beheads a corpse and kicks the head.\\
Kril’go rides the giant deadly sea snake like a cowboy. The druid turns into a fooking octo-kraken and squirts his love juice all over Dev’lada and her stinky weasel before sliding into the sea. It is a tree octopus, which is a fookin scary piece of shit. It can hunt in trees. What a cunt.\\
Grumpy makes the giant snake between Kril’go’s legs really shiny and painful. Tan’lata cant see the octopus cos it’s sneaky as fuck so she splits the giant sea snake in two with a piercing shot.\\
Dev’lada makes her weasel do the dirty work by peering into the water but quickly remembers that it is not a sea weasel and unfortunately cannot do water very well. 1-0 to tree octopi.\\
More giant snakes comes out which Kril’go thought was a log but it nips him and savages him. The greasy weasel gets fucked by a tentacle but isn’t quite dead.\\
Grumpy starts massaging a dead snake trying to make it come to life, it takes a long time because he is old.\\
Tan’lata brambles an octopus in water. It surrounds the octopus. He thinks he’s a tree octopus but he cant do shit against a fookin bramble bush. 1-1 GABRINS EQUALISE\\
Kril’go is a fucking beast and rips a giant sea snake in half which also flips the boat. Tan’lata falls out of the rigging but she’s a motherfuckin’ Chris Tingle Dress Ninja and lands starfished on the edge of the boat.\\
Dev’lada is “pinned in place by her nearly dead, greasy half on fire weasle”. She tries to launch herself off the crossbow forgetting she broke the shit out of it. The weasel is not a crossbow expert. Dev’lada is not a life expert but she knows where the giant octopus is. With this information she does what stephen’s characters do best and runs away, ready for “gigantic penetration from tiny octopuses”\\
The octopus gets fucked by brambles cos he’s a mug so he goes and hugs a deadly sea snake for comfort. THe snake carries him onto the ship like a big slippery stallion. Somehow this fixes the boat.\\
Snaketopus attempts to fuck up Tan’lata, she avoids the snake (she’s had lots of practice) but falls to japanese anime tropes and gets brutalised by tentacles.\\
Grumpy is still massaging his snake.\\
Tan’lata doesn’t want to be bukkake’d so she slips out. And gets up the rigging to safety.\\
Kril’go keeps frothing and hitting because he’s had a complete change of personality recently. He almost brutally murders the octopus. Dev’lada sees her moment to steal the glory and kills the octopus.\\
Grumpy is still massaging his snake. It doesn’t rouse at all.\\
Tan’lata jumps out of the mast and fires some beast-mode arrow shots like PEW PEW PEW but she forgets she is in a mast and smacks her face into the balustrade, falling onto the deck where she perfectly lands into a rope hole.\\
Kril’go doesn’t give a fuck anymore and eats a snake while spinning a nagi’nata. He murders the snake and also the weasel and slightly his daughter.\\
Dev’lada tugs on her greasy weasel to rescue it and notices the giant snake is still around. She attacks but there is too much greast and blood. The snake is in its perfect environment and wraps up Kril’go. Grumpy is still massaging his snake. It has begun to stir.\\
Tan’lata kills the last snake, peering out of her rope hideyhole.\\
Dev’lada saves her weasel by stuffing her juicy berries into its mouth. Tan’lata tries to stop her and give her a life lesson but Dev’lada just wants to ram them in.\\
As the combat ends, Grumpy finally gets his snake going and it sputters into a half-life. The party decide the boat is a piece of shit and decide riding a giant sea snake is a much cooler way of getting into town.\\
The goblins set a lovely campfire on the boat and ride off into the distance straddled across grumpy’s giant undead snake.\\
The boat explodes, nobody looks back.\\
We land in a forest and dont really know where we are so trust Grumpy because he’s great. Our snake follows us.\\
We try to sneak through a forest full of awful creatures. Another tree octopus and a death hippo and some fecking wolves. We get halfway before the octopus spots Kril’go because he is not sneek. Grumpy saves the day by throwing his giant undead snake at it which constricts the octopus in some awful smut pile.\\
Tan’lata snuck on her own because she’s a lone wolf. It fails. The death hippo notices her and goes in for the kill. She does not see the gigantic hippo creature which knocks over the tree she is hiding on, felling it. It snorts through its eyes at her. It’s all fucked.\\
The rest of the gabrins listen to grumpy’s tale of his family’s gruesome death.\\
Dev’lada tries to help but doesn’t do much. Kril’go trusts Tan’lata because she is a badass and watches sat on a log as Tan’lata skewers the pig after backflipping onto its head. There is a light smatter of applause.\\
We arrived at a great city of emancipated Goblins. There is a big cloud. It looks like a cloud and not a dragon because dragons do not exist. The village is in ruins, the gabrins are sad. Kolo’s throat is sore so he takes a break from the story.
